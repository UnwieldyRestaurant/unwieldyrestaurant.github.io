on this channel we're no stranger to old
0:04
servers from the streams i've tried on
0:06
escape restart to the mini series on
0:08
minecraft online which i promise i'll
0:10
probably update in the future it's been
0:13
a tradition for over a year now to check
0:15
in on some of the oldest servers still
0:16
around to preserve their history to the
0:18
best of our abilities now throughout my
0:21
time making videos about the oldest
0:23
servers i've seen an argument come up
0:25
again and again most people have
0:27
narrowed it down to just two being
0:29
nerd.new and minecraft online nerd.new
0:33
launched way back in june 2009 but is
0:36
constantly reset and shut down over the
0:38
last 12 years minecraft online on the
0:41
other hand launched about a year later
0:43
when survival multiplayer was released
0:45
but has been running the same map
0:47
non-stop for over a decade players argue
0:50
back and forth about whether their
0:51
favorite server truly holds the claim to
0:53
being the oldest server around but what
0:56
if i told you there was a third nearly
0:58
unknown server in the competition a
1:01
survival server that launched the same
1:03
day as minecraft online but running a
1:05
world that started months earlier in
1:08
this episode of minecraft uncovered
1:10
we're going to be exploring the story of
1:12
novilen an ancient forgotten minecraft
1:15
server that just might be considered the
1:18
oldest around
1:21
before we get into anything i have to
1:23
give a few important shout outs firstly
1:26
to for unto christ a moderator of
1:28
minecraft online that let me know about
1:31
the server several days ago i also want
1:33
to thank dograph i hope i'm pronouncing
1:35
that right a moderator of novolen for
1:37
inviting my friend in the first place
1:39
and finally i want to thank saplo
1:41
another smaller youtuber that recently
1:43
brought some attention to the server and
1:45
really got the ball rolling honestly
1:47
prior to saplow's video novolin was
1:49
virtually unknown for most of the day it
1:52
was completely empty and the server
1:54
would peak at a player count of five but
1:57
today because of his contributions to
1:59
the community the server is averaging
2:01
around twice that definitely check him
2:03
out if you're interested in anything
2:05
regarding novolin he actually just
2:07
posted another video interviewing the
2:08
owner of the server but speaking of
2:10
novolin what actually is it how did it
2:13
begin how has it evolved and most
2:16
importantly how haven't we heard of it
2:18
well there's certainly a bit of a story
2:21
let's take a trip down memory lane
2:23
august 3rd 2010 minecraft
2:26
1.0.15 had just released the newest
2:29
iteration of survival mode build 15
2:32
wasn't a huge update to the game mainly
2:35
just bringing bug fixes crafting changes
2:37
you know small things but among the
2:40
small things was this a conspicuous ip
2:43
address field on the main screen of the
2:45
game now by this point in the game's
2:48
development multiplayer wasn't unheard
2:50
of there had been unofficial creative
2:52
tests in minecraft classic since may of
2:54
2009 and notch had even opened the
2:57
server for survival testing over the
2:59
last few weeks but never before did it
3:01
seem like minecraft was close to
3:03
officially supporting user run
3:05
multiplayer the only question now was
3:08
when there wasn't any sort of server
3:11
software or tutorial on how to get a
3:13
server up and running all that we could
3:15
see was a text field that was so far
3:17
pretty useless
3:19
but the minecraft community wouldn't
3:21
have to wait much longer on august 4th
3:23
of 2010 the one-year anniversary of the
3:26
first survival test survival multiplayer
3:29
officially released to the public and
3:31
hundreds of players rushed to set up
3:33
their very own server to share with
3:35
friends or even open to the public among
3:37
these were some of the biggest names in
3:39
the history of minecraft multiplayer
3:42
names like minecraft online which is
3:44
generally considered the oldest
3:45
minecraft server and crazy fool's uk a
3:49
lesser known server that had risen to
3:50
the top back in the day but they weren't
3:53
the only ones in fact even on the crazy
3:56
fools uk website you can catch a glimpse
3:58
of the minecraft multiplayer scene on
4:00
day one servers like aunt jemima's home
4:03
style survival and s p just for screwing
4:06
around a partial anarchy server called
4:08
nefanya and so on today these servers
4:11
have long since been forgotten shutting
4:14
down over a decade ago in most cases but
4:17
among these empty husks was a familiar
4:19
name novolin launched at day one of the
4:23
multiplayer release novalin grew quickly
4:25
as one of the smoothest servers online
4:27
at the time and started getting tons of
4:30
new players from server lists forum
4:32
posts and friends sharing it with each
4:34
other but for a while nothing really set
4:36
novalin apart that was until august 28th
4:40
with the release of runecraft the
4:42
longest running minecraft plugin which
4:44
is still being updated to this day
4:46
runecraft adds runic magic to the game
4:49
allowing players to teleport across the
4:51
map lift massive islands out of the
4:53
ocean clone their creations build nearly
4:56
invincible sets of gear and much much
4:59
more back in 2010 the technology was
5:02
pretty primitive as you can imagine but
5:04
you have to understand that the
5:06
expectations were low nothing like this
5:08
had ever been done before
5:10
in 2010 your idea of a plugin would be a
5:13
few new commands for banning players or
5:15
setting homes you could respawn at not
5:17
summoning an acid storm over your worst
5:19
enemies a project like runecraft was
5:22
practically unheard of and it turned
5:24
novolin from a basic survival into an
5:27
active war zone it was chaos with
5:30
players running around at mach speed in
5:32
the hopes of finding weak new players to
5:34
savagely murder and pathetic dirt huts
5:36
they could destroy but while i guarantee
5:39
it was pretty crazy in these early days
5:41
today that history has disappeared aside
5:44
from a few posts on the recently
5:46
resurrected forum the disorder of early
5:48
novolin has been lost to time and after
5:51
a few months after newer servers and
5:53
wilder game modes began to release
5:55
novolin's player count slowly dropped
5:58
lower and lower was this going to be the
6:01
end
6:03
well of course not i mean come on i'm
6:06
playing on the server right now it can't
6:07
be minecraft's oda server if it doesn't
6:09
exist anymore but how did it survive
6:13
well to be honest luck novolin had the
6:16
perfect combination of luck and
6:18
nostalgia to keep a small
6:20
loyal player base over the years and
6:22
when i say small i mean small one or two
6:25
players on at a time but it was enough
6:28
to keep this piece of minecraft history
6:30
alive throughout the years and even
6:32
today as we enter 2022 there are still
6:35
players around from the start of the
6:37
novolin timeline players like dograph
6:39
and doozy have stuck around for the last
6:42
decade several of them even becoming
6:44
moderators of the server and aside from
6:46
the owner's good intentions they're
6:48
really all that's kept novolin alive to
6:50
this day from 2011 through november of
6:53
2021 that's all they've had just a small
6:56
group of maybe a hundred or so players
6:58
that would actively play the server plus
7:00
the rare visitor from some old minecraft
7:02
forum post a youtube video from 2011 or
7:05
something else of the sort but come late
7:08
november of this year that would all
7:10
start to change
7:11
and this this is where saplo makes an
7:14
appearance like myself saplow was no
7:17
stranger to documenting minecraft
7:19
history interviewing players of sim pvp
7:22
anarchy making his own alpha server and
7:24
even uploading a few minecraft online
7:26
videos over the years something was
7:28
different this time around though
7:30
something was special this wasn't just
7:32
some random server with a reputation for
7:34
being old this was a well-kept secret he
7:37
had hidden away for over a year and on
7:40
november 27th he revealed it in his
7:42
first video since july
7:44
minecraft's oldest unknown server now
7:47
saplo is a smaller youtuber but this
7:50
video did honestly pretty well he got
7:53
500 views in under a week numbers i
7:55
could have only dreamed of having when
7:56
my channel was the size of his
7:58
but more importantly a few important
8:01
figures took notice and began to spread
8:03
the word moderators of minecraft online
8:06
popular 2b2t youtubers like dig mc and
8:09
fast vincent and even just regulars of
8:11
the minecraft history community began to
8:13
share it with friends post about it on
8:15
their discords and invite anyone they
8:17
could to populate this once wasteland of
8:20
a server and it worked right now the
8:22
server's healthier than it's been in
8:24
years and we just might be able to bring
8:27
the story of novolin to the masses so
8:30
here i am doing my part 11 years after
8:33
the launch of the server to give the
8:34
minecraft community a glimpse into the
8:37
mystery that is novolin
8:40
thanks for watching the video and i
8:42
really hope you all enjoyed i've been
8:43
wanting to make another old server video
8:45
for quite a while now so i was super
8:47
happy to get the news from foreign to
8:48
christ shout out to you of course and
8:50
dograph since you're basically the
8:52
reason that i'm here and of course shout
8:54
out to saplo as well since he's the
8:56
reason everybody else is here i'll leave
8:57
a link to his channel in the description
8:59
he has two videos on the server already
9:01
and another one is premiering soon but
9:03
that's about all i've got to say so yeah
9:05
thanks again and have a good one guys
9:07
peace
