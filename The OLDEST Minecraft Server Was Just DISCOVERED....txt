in 2016 2b2t took the internet and
0:04
minecraft community by storm a minecraft
0:07
server which has been running since 2010
0:09
on the same map with bases over 10 years
0:11
old from beta versions of the game and a
0:13
never-before-seen detailed history with
0:16
its popularity people started to become
0:19
interested in minecraft history and old
0:21
minecraft servers for a while 2b2t was
0:24
considered the oldest minecraft server
0:25
until players dug deeper and discovered
0:27
minecraft online a server running the
0:29
same map that has never been reset for
0:31
over 11 years which began the day
0:34
minecraft survival multiplayer was
0:35
officially released at this point
0:38
players thought that was it a server
0:40
which began on the same day minecraft
0:41
multiplayer was released there can't be
0:43
any older
0:44
however another lesser known server
0:46
nerd.new was discovered found have been
0:49
running since june the 10th 2009 before
0:51
minecraft even had survival mode in its
0:53
older classic creative multiplayer
0:55
however nerd.nu had reset its map
0:58
multiple times over the years and as
1:00
such was no longer using the same map
1:02
which it began with such as how
1:03
minecraft online had therefore many
1:06
players still considered minecraft
1:07
online to be the oldest server as it had
1:09
the oldest running minecraft world with
1:11
immense history
1:13
until now recently only about a week ago
1:16
another server was discovered completely
1:19
hidden from the internet with only four
1:21
videos total coming up on youtube upon
1:23
doing a basic search a server which has
1:25
also been running since minecraft
1:27
survival multiplayer released on august
1:29
4th 2010 rivaling the age of minecraft
1:31
online a server with a tiny community of
1:34
active players who are still active in
1:36
playing 10 years later a minecraft
1:38
server which has an older map than
1:40
minecraft online beginning before even
1:43
minecraft multiplayer was released
1:44
publicly today we'll be talking about
1:46
novella and its immense history this
1:49
video is a special one so be sure to

1:56
on november the 28th small youtuber
1:58
saplo released a video titled
2:00
minecraft's oldest unknown server i
2:02
found the server by i like i'd spend a
2:05
lot of time and i did spend like a lot
2:07
of time
2:08
looking through the archives essentially
2:09
what i was like okay i want to find an
2:11
old minecraft server saplo had an
2:13
interest in old minecraft servers and
2:14
had been searching for older servers on
2:16
old web pages only accessible through
2:18
the internet archive otherwise known as
2:20
the wayback machine so i went to the
2:22
serverless sites and i just went 2010.
2:24
that's the uh that's the day i'm going
2:26
back to he would scour these old
2:28
minecraft server listing pages many of
2:30
which had ceased to exist long ago and
2:32
like i didn't go on the actual site's
2:34
current day sites and look up 2010
2:36
servers because i was like there's too
2:37
many new servers you're not going to
2:38
find those anyone who could find them
2:40
there would have already done it so i
2:41
went on the back machine i was thinking
2:42
someone already would have had that done
2:44
but all of the pages there have been
2:46
untouched by anyone and i was the only
2:48
first person to ever go through
2:50
looking for 2010 servers on september
2:53
the 31st 2020 he found something uh i'm
2:56
thinking it went through like roughly
2:58
like 5 000 ip addresses an old capture
3:01
of the minecraft forum server listing
3:03
section from august 14 2010 not even two
3:06
weeks after survival multiplayer was
3:07
released here was a list of servers
3:10
submitted by users ordered by the last
3:11
time they were seen online i did way
3:14
more like after i found the server i was
3:15
like well there's got to be more so i
3:17
just kept searching and i was right i
3:19
found a lot more amongst the sea of
3:21
servers lost to time lay novolen a
3:24
dedicated server with a large existing
3:26
map with random stuff to be found and
3:27
regular backups of course
3:29
googling novolen doesn't really give
3:31
that many results there is a simple
3:33
website with a web map viewer as we'll
3:35
get to later and the website also
3:36
displays the service plugins or features
3:38
and a few of its custom recipes and a
3:40
brief history there also exists a few
3:42
listings on minecraft server sites many
3:44
of which are hidden due to the server's
3:45
tiny player base besides that there are
3:48
a handful of posts on reddit the
3:49
minecraft forums and planet minecraft
3:51
many of which are years old and got
3:53
minimal attention heading to youtube now
3:55
and besides zaplo's video doing a simple
3:57
search only reveals four videos which
4:00
combined don't even have 1 000 views
4:02
total with the most recent being from
4:03
three years ago yeah i mounted monitored
4:06
it for an entire year dude i saw two
4:08
people online at the same time once
4:11
is that it or maybe it was three people
4:12
it's like it never goes above three at
4:14
online at one time like i remember it
4:17
clearly there were more than two people
4:18
online one time and i was like yep
4:20
that's the most i've ever seen online
4:22
and then it never happened again and
4:23
that's been a year before saplo's video
4:25
the server was only averaging one to
4:27
three players online at best and their
4:29
discord server only had about 70 people
4:31
in it it was a tiny community which had
4:33
lasted over a decade
4:37
the founder and server operator are boss
4:40
rayuka or rob as we'll refer to him as
4:42
has been running the server since its
4:43
inception but what makes novelland so
4:45
unique is that their map is even older
4:47
than the server itself
4:49
rob originally used this map as a single
4:51
player world meaning much of the terrain
4:53
near the original spawn was generated
4:54
before the server went online in fact
4:57
much of the early terrain was generated
4:59
even before alpha in minecraft infdev
5:02
when multiplayer released he decided to
5:04
take his single player world and use it
5:06
as a world for the server meaning this
5:08
world is even older than minecraft
5:10
online's world and is likely the oldest
5:12
running minecraft world in existence
5:14
rob told me he created the map on april
5:16
the 9th 2010 about 4 months before
5:18
minecraft survival multiplayer was
5:20
released and the server went online the
5:22
version the map was originally generated
5:24
in was inf dev
5:26
2010413 what makes novellan's map so
5:29
interesting is that rob liked to
5:31
experiment with various plugins
5:32
especially world edits creating
5:34
interesting and unique terrain and
5:35
structures on the server we walked a
5:37
couple hundred blocks from spawn one and
5:39
stumbled upon floating island terrain
5:41
generation which rob mentioned was from
5:43
an old adventure map made for minecraft
5:45
classic which rob copied and pasted into
5:47
the game because why not it has long
5:49
since been abandoned however this is a
5:51
common theme across the server unique
5:53
and interesting builds have been built
5:55
abandoned and left to age over time
5:57
while exploring i also found items on
5:59
the ground from where it seemed the
6:00
player had died it's likely that these
6:02
items may have been sitting in unloaded
6:04
chunks for years just waiting for
6:05
somebody to stumble across them because
6:07
the server is so small builds and bases
6:09
are nicely dispersed around the map and
6:11
you could be exploring what you perceive
6:12
to be the wilderness only to stumble
6:14
upon a base built half a dozen if not
6:16
more years ago what i'm trying to say is
6:18
that the server does not feel like a
6:19
museum minecraft online is a great
6:22
server but due to its immense popularity
6:24
you have to go out thousands of blocks
6:25
to build a base and are tightly
6:26
monitored to ensure not even a single
6:28
torch is broken in older areas novolin
6:31
doesn't feel like this at all and feels
6:32
like a survival server straight out of
6:34
2011 with various old bases coupled with
6:36
a vast and open space for players to
6:38
build right nearby mobs still spawn in
6:40
high frequency and threaten you there is
6:42
basically zero lag it feels like it
6:44
never strayed from its survival routes
6:46
there is an almost endless list of cool
6:48
builds from simple decade old houses to
6:51
massive cities and recreations of famous
6:53
and recognizable things there's an
6:54
awesome map viewer on the official
6:56
website which not only displays a bird's
6:58
eye view of the entire map but also has
6:59
markers displaying the build's name and
7:01
where warps are so you can hop on the
7:03
server and easily go to it because there
7:05
are so many builds i talk about a few of
7:07
the most major which have some
7:08
interesting backstories as well as some
7:10
of the oldest which predate the server's
7:11
release the citadel is one of the oldest
7:14
builds on the server built by rob back
7:15
in inf dev before the server was even in
7:17
multiplayer a large box-shaped fortress
7:20
which towers high above the land around
7:22
it rob was kind enough to send me a save
7:24
of the world from inf dev so we can
7:26
compare what some of his oldest builds
7:27
look like then and now the citadel has a
7:29
nice garden area within its walls as
7:31
well as a moat coated with furnaces
7:33
ironside is a famous stone city built by
7:36
a single player over the span of five
7:37
years on and off i personally like the
7:39
jets the most in this build and just for
7:41
fun they copied and pasted the entire
7:42
city and blew it up as well
7:44
warping to dog star reveals two massive
7:46
star destroyers from star wars who
7:48
entirely from stone oh and if you're
7:50
wondering what's with all the oddly
7:52
shaped obsidian portals found all around
7:54
the map this was from a plugin called
7:55
stargate which allowed players to walk
7:57
into portals and teleport to specific
7:59
locations a plug-in would stop being
8:01
updated in your minecraft versions this
8:03
right here is another one of rob's
8:04
earlier spaces but before the server was
8:06
even a thing rob also built this tower
8:09
nearby which he used to find his way
8:11
around the map and prevent him from
8:12
getting lost the trees all around the
8:14
map also looked strange as back when
8:15
this terrain was generated only one type
8:17
of leaf block existed and three updates
8:19
with the addition of new leaves there
8:20
was a bug which caused current tree
8:22
leaves to get replaced and will look
8:23
quite funky here's another one of rob's
8:26
earlier spaces built in the middle of a
8:27
river rob would use these old style
8:29
torch locks to prevent the sand from
8:31
falling and leading water into the base
8:34
paragon is one of the largest bases on
8:36
the server supposedly built seven to
8:38
eight years ago with some players
8:39
stating it may have been built in 2010
8:41
the insides are like a maze and really
8:44
give off that old-style base fill
8:45
however what's cool is that if you head
8:47
to the top of the base you'll realize
8:49
that you've been in a massive aircraft
8:51
carrier surrounded by aircrafts the base
8:53
was originally built in a tiny lake but
8:55
rob moved it to a massive ocean lesserk
8:57
is one of the more modern looking bases
8:59
which truly looks astonishing straight
9:01
out of a fantasy land just goes to show
9:03
that you can also find a variety of
9:04
modern builds on the server especially
9:06
around the newer spawns speaking of
9:08
which the server has 13 spawns normally
9:11
added when there is a new major update
9:12
to the game you can see them on the map
9:14
and warped to them in-game of course one
9:16
spawn is a server's first spawn which
9:18
was already generated by rob in single
9:20
player meaning its terrain is from
9:22
infidel versions here you will find many
9:24
of the older spaces but all the way back
9:26
in the server's earliest days
9:28
but what would an 11 year old minecraft
9:30
server be without his community what's
9:32
so great about novolin is the fact that
9:34
it has had a tight knit community for so
9:36
long i decided to speak with long time
9:38
player and moderator dog rafi and ask
9:41
him about the experiences he has had on
9:42
the server while we tour many older
9:44
towns from 2010 to 2011 which have long
9:46
since been abandoned
9:49
uh my name is dorgraphy yeah i've been
9:51
playing for like 11 years now 10 years
9:53
maybe wow i was 11 when i started i'm 22
9:56
now
9:57
dography has been playing on the server
9:59
since early 2011. and when he first
10:01
joined he hadn't even played
10:02
single-player minecraft before meaning
10:04
this server was his very first
10:06
experience with the game so um how did
10:08
you actually find the server in the
10:09
first place my friend told me about it
10:12
at soccer practice one night
10:14
all right okay and um we just joined and
10:16
he'd been playing for like a month
10:17
previous to me maybe he had some friends
10:20
on here as well so there's a there's a
10:21
big group of us like australians that
10:23
play on here now so this is my this is
10:25
the dude who introduced me his house and
10:26
he said you can live in the basement so
10:29
i
10:29
lived in the basement for a bit all
10:31
right this is like my very first house
10:33
just moved in
10:35
yeah literally this would have been yet
10:36
ten plus years ago it was like the first
10:38
server i ever joined and i pretty much
10:40
haven't played any other ones seriously
10:42
since apart from like you know friends
10:44
hosting of course
10:45
as you can see my building skill is just
10:48
unrivaled
10:49
um
10:51
and this is literally like where i spent
10:52
like
10:54
four weeks somehow so when was the
10:56
server actually i'm most active well i
10:59
would say yeah like when i joined it was
11:01
pretty active it really peaked probably
11:02
in 2013 i would say okay i'd say that's
11:05
about right you know how many plays it
11:06
was getting around then
11:08
well it would often it would often cap
11:10
out so you wouldn't be able to get in
11:11
unless like you you know remember or
11:12
whatever and i think the play limit was
11:14
15
11:15
maybe 20. so that was pretty common that
11:17
was like every couple of days or maybe
11:18
on the weekends it would cap out this
11:20
was built you know pre 1.8 venture
11:23
update 2011 yeah definitely so
11:26
these players who have set up the shops
11:27
here they're really active anymore and
11:28
not so much oh no like you know like
11:31
there's probably just probably two
11:33
players that i've seen in the last year
11:34
that were around at this time and so
11:37
you're a mod on the server now aren't
11:38
you yeah yeah so do you actually have
11:41
many issues with uh trolls griefers or
11:43
anything they actually have to do much
11:44
moderating back like uh pre maybe i
11:47
think it was like 2015 we had like a
11:49
fair bit of shoes like the server was
11:51
pretty popular so you'd get a lot of new
11:52
players but um we lost like all our band
11:54
records at one point in 2015 and so
11:57
everyone that was banned got unbanned
11:58
and we were expecting a huge wave of
12:00
griefers to come in but um it never
12:02
happened and we pretty much didn't have
12:03
any griefs for five years after that
12:05
this would be 2010 easily um this is
12:07
before me even i think so oh wow yeah
12:10
that's interesting this is this is
12:11
really cool actually this is it yeah
12:13
this is like the this really has that
12:14
vibe doesn't it so this was a
12:16
one of novellas former mods i think sort
12:18
of made this amex a mix a lot so he's
12:21
not active anymore
12:22
no we've lost like a lot of a lot of
12:24
mods over time you know they probably
12:25
all have kids now like that you know
12:28
10 years ago so so
12:30
it's kind of scary but is that um
12:33
obtained legitimately
12:36
baby
12:42
what do you like most about the
12:43
community they're all really like
12:45
friendly and they're all really like uh
12:46
supportive and i've never had any like
12:49
toxicity issues with anybody on this
12:50
server like there's always like that
12:52
good vibe going i think they're just a
12:54
nice group of people really and it's
12:56
nice seeing old builds and i mean i
12:57
spend i don't even build that much stuff
12:59
anymore on the server i spend most of my
13:00
time just like flying around looking at
13:02
yeah it's at buildings because there's
13:04
so many like it's just i find new stuff
13:06
every day do you recognize any of these
13:07
creators digital mischief or castle
13:10
i think digital mischief was a moderator
13:12
for a while daniel jackson what and
13:14
albus were like this sort of original
13:15
three and then i think kazanyo and
13:17
jacksonville were just like up on our
13:19
friends or whatever so they sort of
13:21
stopped playing over the years but they
13:22
sometimes pop in and like have a look
13:23
around and compliment people's builds or
13:25
whatever but yeah they haven't been on
13:26
for years
13:28
this is a
13:29
castle here
13:31
it has cyan wall
13:33
um as it's like points so they used to
13:35
be diamond blocks but someone someone
13:37
came and stole the wall and replaced
13:38
them
13:39
and i think like it went unnoticed for a
13:41
while but
13:43
looking at that now it's pretty obvious
13:45
since you've been playing the server so
13:46
long would you say that there was a
13:48
period where you were most active and
13:49
you just played off and on since then
13:51
yeah well i i sort of just take breaks
13:54
for like months sometimes um but you
13:56
know when i do play which is like you
13:57
know sort of now just started playing
13:59
again it's like i'll just play every day
14:01
for a couple of months or so but it's
14:03
usually because there's just no people
14:05
around so a bunch of people will come on
14:07
and then everyone will start playing
14:08
again and then people will sort of start
14:09
to burn out the server's gone in cycles
14:11
like that for a couple of years now i
14:13
think yeah no that sounds about right of
14:14
course
14:15
it's interesting to see old stuff that
14:17
has like
14:18
unique elements to it i guess
14:20
um this isn't that old really um
14:24
pretty awesome though uh you know it's
14:26
in the jungle biome
14:28
currently the service world border is 20
14:30
000 blocks in each direction and the
14:31
server is on 1.17.1
14:34
there are currently 13 spawns and so
14:35
many warps i can't even count them all
14:37
oh and if you're curious where the
14:39
server's name came from it's a reference
14:40
to the heinlein novel the moon is a
14:42
harsh mistress where novolen is short
14:44
for a russian city named new leningrad
14:47
the server has a few plugins such as
14:48
runecraft which adds magic runes and
14:51
unique features to the game keeping in
14:52
theme with the server runecraft is one
14:54
of the longest running minecraft mods
14:56
dating back to 2010 with its earliest
14:58
versions created for minecraft alpha
15:00
there's also some custom recipes as you
15:02
can see on the website while the smp is
15:04
the main attraction the server also has
15:06
a classic style creative plot world
15:08
which has been running for quite some
15:09
time as well you can also go to slash
15:11
warp old creative to really get a blast
15:13
from the past rob has pasted in one of
15:15
his older minecraft classic creative
15:17
worlds which potentially dates back all
15:19
the way to 2009 which you can fly around
15:22
and explore but building is mostly
15:23
limited to the plot world now the
15:25
community is extremely friendly and
15:27
welcoming as is common amongst older and
15:29
more mature minecraft servers joining
15:31
the server exploring it and talking with
15:33
the players gave me more of a private
15:35
smp with friends feel rather than a
15:37
massive public and a motionless server
15:40
if you do decide to check the server out
15:41
please be respectful and friendly with
15:43
the active players this is not an
15:45
anarchy server remember so there are
15:46
rules and cheating is not tolerated i'll
15:48
leave links to their discord and website
15:50
down below as well as where you can go
15:52
to donate thank you to everyone on the
15:54
server who showed me around and told me
15:56
about the servers immense history it was
15:58

15:59
