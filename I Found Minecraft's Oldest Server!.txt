the year is 2020 september 31st
0:04
i found something
0:05
[Music]
0:09
i had always felt something amazing was
0:12
hidden within the thousands of server
0:13
addresses preserved on the wayback
0:15
machine's archives the idea of checking
0:18
the wayback machine's archives for old
0:20
minecraft servers was so simple
0:23
that it felt
0:25
stupid to think someone hadn't have
0:27
already checked it
0:29
and found everything there was to be
0:31
found or found nothing after
0:34
a mild amount of deliberation i decided
0:37
to go for it i decided to give looking
0:39
for an unreset 2010 server a shot it's
0:42
lucky that i did because i just so
0:44
happened to find this this server the
0:47
one that i'm making this video about
0:49
minecraft.novalin.net
0:51
here's the website
0:53
on the server website there's a live map
0:56
viewer what i saw there
0:58
made the entire search worth it it was a
1:01
massive expanse of generated terrain
1:03
filled with abandoned builds the middle
1:06
of the server consists of nothing but
1:08
alpha generated terrain
1:10
i did what i thought was impossible i
1:12
found a perfectly preserved still active
1:14
survival server from 2010
1:18
in an hour no map resets and a very
1:21
small but dedicated community of players
1:23
the map was actually the single player
1:26
world used by the owner so the map
1:28
actually has older generated chunks than
1:31
the version of the server was started on
1:33
as of writing this their discord
1:35
contains 75 people
1:38
my own discord has more than that i am
1:41
not a popular youtuber by any means
1:44
but my entire community of people is
1:47
more than who play this server after
1:49
asking the owner some questions i was
1:51
told that the server was created august
1:53
4th 2010 the day minecraft multiplayer
1:56
was released
1:58
this just so happens to be the exact day
2:00
another server by the name of minecraft
2:03
online was created
2:05
another unreset survival server the main
2:08
difference between the two servers is
2:10
its popularity novlin has 10 active
2:13
players a week at best minecraft online
2:16
has multiple million view videos made on
2:18
it and it averages 20 players daily i
2:21
was incredibly lucky in finding novolim
2:23
when so many people haven't
2:26
the owner has informed me that only a
2:28
few thousand people have joined over the
2:30
past 11 years
2:32
the community that does play has been
2:35
very busy building the map is riddled
2:37
with interesting complex and high effort
2:40
builds
2:41
one of the best things to come from the
2:44
lack of player activity is how spacious
2:46
the world is you can literally hop onto
2:48
the server walk over to the alpha and
2:51
beta chunks and build your base there
2:53
without feeling like you're invading
2:54
someone else's space
2:56
something you can't do in minecraft
2:58
online so anywhere on minecraft online
3:01
pretty much server performance is
3:03
amazing especially given that the server
3:05
runs the most current version of the
3:07
game as of writing this 1.17.1
3:11
the world is split into separate spawns
3:13
which are all accessible through a
3:15
portal plug-in system
3:17
current spawn is nowhere near the beta
3:19
and alpha chunks
3:21
the server also offers a creative mode
3:24
world which has been reset in the past
3:27
novlen is one of minecraft's oldest
3:29
servers ranking in top five at least
3:33
according to my calculations and i
3:35
happen to be slightly more educated in
3:38
this topic than
3:39
uh the people who write those website
3:41
blogs
3:42
so don't trust them they don't know
3:44
anything and is a long-lost sister
3:46
server of sorts to minecraft online it
3:49
is absolutely amazing the server exists
3:52
and that it has gone completely under
3:54
the radar with this video i hope to have
3:56
fixed that a link to novolin's discord
3:59
server and website are located in the
4:01
