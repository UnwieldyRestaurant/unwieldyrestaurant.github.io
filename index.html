<br>
Plenty of things in this really long video and to make things easier for you when watching especially if you don't want to watch the entire thing i have bookmarked all the questions that are asked in this video in the description and you can just kind of click the time stamps in the description and you will get to the question if you want to just know the answer to a specific one enjoy hello uh our boss uh can you uh explain to everyone a little bit about<br>
<br>
Who you are um well i'm a dude who runs a minecraft server among other things i'm 40-ish i've been running minecraft servers on and off for like 15 years no no i don't know if it goes that far back but i used to run the old classic creative servers for funsies<br>
<br>
And uh transitioned into multiplayer a while back too um i do i t for pers for [Music] i have a cat he's black he's very fat all same same yeah okay that's uh that's a pretty good introduction for you there um yeah it's just uh it's very exciting it's very exciting to<br>
<br>
Be doing this right now um yeah so you've been you've been running this server um for uh over 10 years now is that that's correct yeah that is the case it's it's been a long road yeah that's that is just absolutely nuts all right so we're gonna do this interview i will start with the first questions uh like the first official ones<br>
<br>
Why did you start the server um well i enjoyed playing minecraft you know at the time it was it was minecraft has always been a unique experience from the beginning it was kind of the first of its genre a really genre defining kind of game and it was fun to play and as someone who's technologically inclined and who's always kind of looking for opportunities to sharpen<br>
<br>
My tech technical skills um it's kind of offered an opportunity to encounter challenges in server challenges in it maintenance that you wouldn't really run into otherwise it kind of motive it kind of creates i like to create myself problems sometimes so that you can figure out ways to solve them and it's a good way to kind of keep your<br>
<br>
Keep your hat in the ring if your ordinary job doesn't really create opportunities to learn new skills and creating a minecraft server has given me the opportunity to learn about server virtualization about maintenance backups various technologies regarding containerization and you know how to run a website how to run a wiki<br>
<br>
Um and there's also a lot of other fun little site projects involving like how to run an economy how does an economy work how does money work how does inflation work um how do you how do you create and maintain a player base that is you know with as few unsavory elements as possible you know how do you get the<br>
<br>
Nice people to float to the top and the crappy people look to the floor to the book to sink to the bottom and that's there's all sorts of little fun um projects that are kind of subsumed within the entire minecraft umbrella you know yeah um all right uh where where does the server name come from on like the similar note<br>
<br>
Not many people ask about this it's from a robert a heinlein book the moon is a harsh mistress uh naviland is the name of the russian city on the moon new leningrad navi leningrad and it's uh just a silly literary reference and one of my favorite books heinlein is uh is is one of my favorite authors and uh the moon is irish mistress is a is a good book to come back to from time<br>
<br>
To time uh it's it's kind of a libertarian sort of utopian novel which has its own problems and but uh it's a fun read i'll definitely uh maybe check it out after this yeah it's pretty short a couple hundred pages uh it doesn't oh sorry i can continue oh it's a good adventure story about like a revolution<br>
<br>
On the moon all right yeah that's cool is it like kind of like uh like a like a com like a commentary on like socialism or something like that or comedy yeah yeah it kind of mirrors the american revolution it's heinlein's idea of what an ideal ideal libertarian society would look like and how it might develop it uh and it has a lot of allusions to uh different like the spanish revolution so<br>
<br>
The spanish civil war for instance and the american revolution and uh bits and pieces of the soviet um the soviet revolution and how that came to pass and you can dig into it this there's some literary uh meat on that bone okay that sounds very interesting yeah so go hopping off from uh like the the server name what about like the world itself does it have like a special name that you've got for it<br>
<br>
Oh no none at all no it is the server it is the map the world map okay yeah fair enough it's just like continue in my scripts it's just called smp i see i see yeah just because like uh minecraft online which is the other server um that's like similar to this uh they they called their their world freedomia but they're mine the server is called minecraft online so i was just yeah<br>
<br>
Um what keeps you motivated to keep the server running uh guilt um because so many people have put so much work into it at this point that i can spare a few minutes to keep it going um and it you know it helps keep the skills sharpened a little bit yeah like i said it gives me a reason to do things and there's a there's such a good group of<br>
<br>
People that um i i'd hate to disappoint them um as soon as occasionally i just think of i feel like i want to just let go of the whole project and kind of let it languish or publish the map online as a torrent somewhere and just let people deal with it but then somebody asks me<br>
<br>
Hey have you checked out this build or do you want to install this plug-in for me and i'll be like oh fine so in that case the player base are kind of like my pets it's like a giant tamagotchi that's kind of like a fun way of looking at it uh yeah the players are gonna love me talking them talking about them like that i'm sure uh yeah cause they're kind of in the same van have you like considered like<br>
<br>
I'm guessing you've considered shutting the server down a lot like like is that something you think about a lot or oh from time to time like sometimes things get super broken or another plug-in breaks for the thousandth time and yeah then i'm just like you know what i i've threatened to shut it down a few times but it's just never gotten to that point yeah but like uh<br>
<br>
In all of the times you've really considered it when was like the like closest you came to actually like shutting the server down um probably a few years ago when i kind of went through a sort of depressive phase and just couldn't find the spoons to do anything at all and i ended up just leaving it on version 1.13 for a while because i didn't really like i didn't really<br>
<br>
Have the money to upgrade the hardware and i didn't really have the interest in the optimizing out the performance issues and i just did couldn't really be bothered to care about it for quite a while so mostly i just kind of let it stay at a pretty static level for a while and neglect tried to neglect it to death you know<br>
<br>
Like sometimes you just don't have the courage to kill something outright and you just kind of forget about it for a while and just don't think about it until it kind of goes away on its own for a while i kind of tried to do that but it it didn't quite succeed yeah and then my my work actually offers me some money every few years to um<br>
<br>
Invest in personal development and every end every couple of cycles of that i can buy new servers with it so i that money came in and then i had then i finally kind of rekindled in interest in rebuilding computer servers in general and uh and uh having a fresh shiny new piece of computer hardware means that you're not i'm no longer struggling with performance issues<br>
<br>
Or hardware limitations and i can just kind of just do things instead of having to struggle with the 15 frames per second or 10 frames per second or whatever and people complaining about like which is kind of nice oh yeah that's that sounds like that sounds like that's really nice especially like uh your work giving you funds to do that on the side a little bit<br>
<br>
It is yeah yeah yeah if i may ask where where do you work um at a university in southwest canada oh that's really cool uh do you enjoy like running the server and like interacting with the community most of the time most of the time it's a great group of people i absolutely love the people that sign into the server and have stuck with it through the years and uh they've made such amazingly<br>
<br>
Beautiful projects that i i can't find it in me to um to take that away from them i see i see uh it's like i get a little secondary pride from other people's work it's like a little end yeah as someone who who runs the minecraft servers as well like i totally get what you're talking about um<br>
<br>
Uh so like i'm i'm guessing just since you've been running the server for so long have you made like any friends like through the server oh yeah yeah a lot of people on the server i would i would consider friends very few of them have i met in person uh one of the moderators was my was an uh a friend that met that we met sorry we met on warcraft<br>
<br>
World of warcraft a couple of years before we start the server and we played together there and transitioned into minecraft and um yeah they're still online from time to time doozy you've probably seen her oh yeah cool yeah and we've known each other for a long time and yeah very few in you know meat-space friendships because you know scattered<br>
<br>
Across the continent [Music] okay um i consider most regulars friends okay cool uh how many players uh do you like all total do you keep in touch with like out of the people who have joined so far outside of minecraft i don't think many one or two really oh yeah i i actually uh miss phrase that question like uh other like early players who joined like<br>
<br>
The first to like year the server was opened or like the first couple years like how many of them do you keep in touch with is or is that most of the community huh i would say there's at least a few yeah you know people people come and people go um people drift on and go move on with their lives get married i mean<br>
<br>
Server's about that old yeah yeah and then in one memorable instance there's one kid who started like age 13 who has since gotten married and had children and he pops back from time to time and says hi which is which is great i love it when people say hi i mean it brings a little light to to a day that's a very crazy a giant nostalgia<br>
<br>
Machine i i swear every time i come in i just find something that goes that makes me go oh my god remember that um yeah what's uh speaking of like finding things on the server what's your uh favorite old build or a build in general like on the server um there's something by that i've made or somebody else just in general like your favorite thing on the server<br>
<br>
Oh we can actually go visit it um if you if you want to i was thinking the cathedral build uh assuming i can find it it's your second spawn which and yeah this is one of the earliest complex built server made by a guy named rainy d2 and i think by modern standards you you you would consider this not super impressive but you have to remember the guy built it in survival and he built it with you<br>
<br>
Know these big complex builds weren't really a thing what year was this oh it had to have been 20 10 late 2010 mid 2010. like it was really crazy 2010 this was made yeah this is right by second spawn which should give you some idea of how and i probably started the second spawn like a couple of months after i started the<br>
<br>
Server you know the first one starts to get a little crowded if you if you look over there you see the tower that's second spot wow that's awesome yeah and there's a little chick in there hill a little chicken hey just put an egg out oh<br>
<br>
Um all right uh so um i just like a question about like the old older older times how like how active was the server in like the old versions like or at least like within like like the first year or two like how how many players did you have oh we'd frequently hit 10 to 15. i mean we would cap out i don't i don't think i've ever really put the server over 15<br>
<br>
Users simultaneously but wait we frequently cap out that okay uh and like it's like pretty quick too like lots of different sign uh different and uh just not stay for very long but uh kind of a core develops gotcha gotcha like uh yeah so how long was did that like uh like player like activity level stay at for like how many years was that five or six years<br>
<br>
I mean we had a pretty steady community for quite a while um minecraft i think minecraft in general stopped being as popular at least minecraft vanilla stopped being a spot because players today have kind of higher expectations minecraft server than just straight up because if you want to play a vanilla minecraft server friend just spin up<br>
<br>
Your own um and uh all the big professional minecraft mini games and such yeah but i've always kind of preferred the uh plane survival experience yeah so like uh why why is there is so little advertising done for the server it seems it's like this is incredibly hard like to find like all relatively speaking i mean i used to i used to advertise i<br>
<br>
Went on the minecraft server.net and put up a post i think i've made a reddit post or two advertising is hard it's fair you know are am i what like am i trying to make a profit i if you're not trying to actually make money from from it if you're not trying to grow it and kind of extract it extract rent from it then what's the point of adwords<br>
<br>
If you have your group of people like and uh have your core of regulars that pop by stuff almost advertising is almost asking for trouble because you're just gonna get a stream of new users and new users are a lot of work i mean you gotta vet them watch them filter them out yes yeah that you know that's it's very understandable like i honestly i think<br>
<br>
It might be easier to find this server like uh if you don't know the name of it um if you go through the wayback machine like i did and look at the old surfer list archives from 2010 that's fine there's just less servers it's um yeah so have like uh you were talking a little bit earlier about um like others minecraft servers like around like like<br>
<br>
2015-14 and being mostly mini game focused and stuff like have you ever considered like adding in kind of game modes like that to this server or was that never really a thing you thought wanted to do or thought about oh yeah we had a mini game side world for quite a while um there was a yeah i played around with a bunch of different plugins i tried to get someone else to maintain it for a while and we went through a couple<br>
<br>
Of minutes uh there's the steward rank which um person responsible for a particular world or a particular map um i did a skype lock world for a while that was fun a lot of people enjoyed that in fact i've still got it kicking around it would be too hard to spin it up again oh okay like yeah so how many of those like mini game things do you still have like set up<br>
<br>
None of them are left since i kept them all on my site uh sites we use the bungie multi server architecture so you can spin up in servers and destroy them as you need which is pretty handy so like uh like the only one that's left is the sky block is it just the splat skyblock uh map not the play no not the map the plugin and not the map that kind of deal<br>
<br>
Oh no i don't have that anymore it was on a separate server it's gone i mean i still have the files and the map still exists it's just not you know running i see i see okay um that's interesting that's cool to know i got something i didn't know before uh i'm glad i asked the question something you could bring back pretty easily yeah um i mean there's definitely room for<br>
<br>
That i'm sure there now especially now there's probably going to be an audience for something like that potentially but the question is how much effort do you want to put yeah exactly i mean i'm only one guy and i don't really need to uh write her to like i don't really want to be a manager and if you have a team of moderators or administrators<br>
<br>
Uh maintaining individual servers then you become a manager it's like who has time that's kind of like the same deal that the the owner of minecraft online is doing um he kind of just stepped away from like actually running the server and he's got like a giant team of moderators who just does everything for him but like they never really talk to him much he's just kind of like away<br>
<br>
From the project now but he keeps it up because you know it's old so yeah kind of like kind of like like to say probably for similar reasons why you do just like don't does don't have the heart to to put it down you know yeah um but he's figured out a way to like keep it like self-sustaining he doesn't have to get involved that's cool getting to that point would be pretty interesting yeah um<br>
<br>
Well that's definitely something to be considered uh uh let's see the next question is uh like what was minecraft like in general like uh back when you first started the server like what was what was the like mechanically and like community wise socially and like the environment back then was was like the vibe what was that what was that like simpler i would say i mean minecraft<br>
<br>
It's kind of gone the lego route you know how lego like you have these lego sets that are basically just a whole bunch of four by two blocks and you can build whatever you want out of those bit of those basic few blocks and then you get into the lego sets that have all these special purpose pieces i think minecraft's kind of gone a little bloaty in that direction that too many special purpose and<br>
<br>
Too much variety of building blocks now you know i actually completely agree with that that doesn't say too much about the culture though but um it's it's more it's more game focused now like people expect more of game from minecraft like minecraft isn't really a game by itself anymore it's more more platform<br>
<br>
Upon which you build games is this like skylocks well yeah we're similar to that what are your thoughts on similar servers to what you like in age to what you're currently running like minecraft online or two builders to tools i mean it sounds like a lot of people are having a lot of fun and more power to them i mean wow<br>
<br>
So much so much amazing gameplay happening there like i personally cannot stand pvp and anarchy servers but i'm really glad that some people are enjoying it and staying away from our server yeah minecraft online is not yeah um you know fair enough fair enough there<br>
<br>
They keep they keep the they attract all the all the nasty ones yeah there's some kind of unsavory elements out there you know the edge lords and yeah oh great nazis and whatnot which are kind of hard to to distinguish from each other sometimes yeah a little bit a little bit can you like describe a little bit of uh what the early days of the server were like<br>
<br>
Oh chaotic lots and lots of griefers so many griefers like right off the bat when the fir when the first smp patch dropped there was no server-side inventory it was all client-side oh yeah literally anybody could spawn literally any item with uh pretty trivial um it wasn't even hacking at that point it was just that how the game worked<br>
<br>
Right so anything you built would get covered in lava instantly there were no there were no there were no protections um in fact i i knew this was going to be a thing so my the very first service fund was not what the cur what the what it what first spawn is i call it like zero spawn so there's just like this little area near<br>
<br>
Out out at like minus two thousand comma zero that it's the actual first spawn point of the server and it got pretty nutty because people just yeah it looked like you you see the 2b 2b gt spawn area it got a bit like that can we actually like can we check that out right now or is that oh probably um let me see if i can<br>
<br>
Figure out where it is exactly yeah that's kind of it's funny to think that that's the uh like the uh true the true first spawn point yeah i uh i filmed this oh you found it all right awesome um i'm just going to drop to the floor all right yeah don't want to teleport me well i'm incredible<br>
<br>
Okay i even have a little spawn region here protecting our little world guard region here protecting it and as silly as it seems this little wall thing might actually be the oldest multiplayer structure on the server really oh wow that's crazy i mean i've restored it and yeah like it used to be bombed out so i've i just ended up restoring it from back up oh wow there's this giant castle oh that<br>
<br>
Castle i saw it on the on the world right now yeah yeah that's sixth spawn a lot of it was edited in but um oh dang it stupid cat is he on your desk yeah i'm covered in orange juice now give me a sec cat would like some attention please but yeah there's a lot of lands landmarks that are kind of like uh<br>
<br>
Unimpressive in in an absolute sense but of note only because they're like the oldest x or uh it's like oh look at this little box structure it's just impressive that it's still there after all these years though so yeah i slept on a protection region on top of it um yeah good times do you have any uh like uh uh fond<br>
<br>
Memories from those times like honestly one of my fonder memories is cleaning up griefing because i enjoy cleaning up other people's messes is kind of it's kind of fun i mean you grumble about it but uh restoring an ugly landscape into something that looks passable this is pretty pretty interesting okay um yeah i can kind of relate i did i've done similar things on my server and some people make some absolutely<br>
<br>
Epic messes oh yeah now now that you have trivial roll black roll backs with core protect and whatnot and log block i mean it kind of takes some of the fun out of restoration work oh i was um because you see that little road to the south there a bit one of my early projects was to kind of just pick a direction and go and just build a road out and this was kind of like as<br>
<br>
Far as i had gone on my personal nap in this direction so i was like you know what this can be the spawn point right here and this this is just far enough away from all my stuff that i'm not too worried about again i see i see yeah um oh yeah you ported the map over from or like you just moved the map over from imp dev to<br>
<br>
To the newest version of uh alpha right yeah yeah it was my multiplayer alpha and i didn't want to rebuild everything so i was just like you know what scp there we go well that might that makes this probably the oldest uh still running minecraft map um yeah i guess you could say that but i mean i'm sure other people have done the same thing<br>
<br>
Well sure but they didn't do probably didn't start it on the same version and go for it like i'm i'm talking like just still going like you're competing with like two other surfers here it's true it's true yeah so if you if you could like date the zero comma zero map it might go a few months before snp i don't remember exactly yeah if it went if it has inft uh<br>
<br>
Generation which it does right then it's it's got a it's got an older map than minecraft online which is the only other server that started the same day as you and kept their map the entire time but they started their server like this the map is the same day as the as the server to my knowledge so i think you get you get the crowning achievement for that one yeah<br>
<br>
Yeah there was a little excitement about the smp release back in the day so a lot of people started up servers back then i'm really surprised not so many people have been well i'm sure a lot of people are still running servers they're just not running the same maps yeah there are i spent many hours searching through old uh old addresses when i was on the way back machine i found probably 50 uh and most of them are just like they<br>
<br>
Reset every year or they're private servers but they're they're there they're still there there's still communities around from that time yeah it it takes a certain amount of bloody minded determination to stay with the same map because oh yeah create so many problems for yourself like old duped items stay around old builds like old farms for instance just because people run into old melon farms or<br>
<br>
Whatever and hey then you've got free food for life it creates gameplay issues because people get can get a whole bunch of free stuff by old builds i mean all those xp farms out in the world so you can just wander up to them and hey free infinite xp and resetting the map kind of solves that problem oh yeah i've got a lot of friends of mine who are like just reset it it'll uh<br>
<br>
Set a map or something like that that's how like you bring fresh life into it everyone gets to the same level playing field right and the progression is back but it's like you lose something else with that in my opinion at least yeah like i can't bring myself to delete all bills there's just such a staggering amount of creativity in them oh yeah and it's like knifing your own child you know<br>
<br>
The partner metaphor i don't know it's it's appropriate it's appropriate i mean you don't want to kick a puppy exactly yeah um yeah so for like hosting the server how do you how do you how did you and like how are you currently hosting the server well i and a friend of mine run a kind of mutual little server remote at his house<br>
<br>
Um and we kind of do it semi-professionally like we we try to like just to keep our skills up we kind of run it as a semi-professional affair so we um use it to keep up to date with certain technologies um so we try to have proper backups set up and we try to have a good virtualization um we try to have a good a good good i.t standard practices you know<br>
<br>
And uh it keeps us in the game well that's awesome seems like the server couldn't be in any better hands yeah yeah i mean it's not something we really run a profit on but we're not trying to the profit is in skill development yeah um what was the world like in inf dev before you had it as a server um overwhelming because before inft diff<br>
<br>
You just had these little 256 by 256 square maps and they were cozy and interesting like uh you used to have just this like this one little island in the middle of the map and it felt very lonely and and that that's great like you're a sole survivor and at the time that was very unique experience um<br>
<br>
A lot a lot of fun but then you go from that into the full kind of minecraft survival experience and you look in any direction and i don't think players these days get just how crazy it is that you look in a direction and it just keeps going forever like you can you can walk in that direction and you will eventually never hit the end i'm not withstanding people like kurt james and his farlands or bust series<br>
<br>
That guy that guy's crazy he's still not there it's been a long time yeah yeah i think he's like 30 of the way oh wow yeah he's doing the overworld trip which is a lot yeah and he hasn't like a world edited himself a straight path or anything there's that one guy who um built himself a highway to the end or the our lands and just held down the w key until he got there<br>
<br>
But uh that sounds that feels like cheating yeah it does yeah but kurt jmx kind of created treated it like a blog or slash button yeah and i i really enjoy it he's he's a he's a comfortable uh speaker and presenter and yeah so like i'm saying i'm guessing you were around when he's for his first uh you were watching his first like<br>
<br>
Videos when they first came out the first few videos here i mean maybe i came in around episode 10 or 12. i i remember him publishing him at the time and being like oh my god is he really going to do that and then i watched him and you know what he's he's he's he's a fun guy i like him bouncing off that uh youtubers thing uh how like for uh like do you watch any like youtube any minecraft youtubers at<br>
<br>
Least as of recent or just in general like do you watch any currently just coaching that cause the only one i've really stuck with and mostly because you know it's a nice low effort podcast to pay attention to sometimes people will link minecraft videos from the server and i'll watch those but i know i find a lot of minecraft youtubers kind of too oriented like they're really fast-paced<br>
<br>
Screaming at you actually no there's that irish guy he he recently did a series about doing minecraft in like one chunk oh and that was fun i'll look him up after this and uh yeah i'll have reference footage on the screen yeah yeah i would recommend him he's very entertaining he's got this amazing irish accent it's the most entertaining part of his<br>
<br>
Videos and some some people will um do their minecraft videos i'll just completely freak out about every these amazingly he's amazingly over-the-top emotional reactions and it comes off as really instancy but uh i really enjoy his book that's awesome it's it's not a common person who can freak out at everything and actually<br>
<br>
Sell it don't call me that's the that's the youtuber calling me kevin all right um who were the first players on the server um well actually that's i uh i can name a few there's rainy 92 he was among those um a couple of the first players actually became my co-admins for a while uh zanio and jack so what we're like one of the day one people who<br>
<br>
Joined and i'm like hey you want to be and then they're like oh fine and they hung around we became pretty close friends for yeah they've since kind of drifted away haven't yeah if they came back i think we'd click again pretty quick well who knows maybe they will uh who knows who knows um yeah are there like any players this is<br>
<br>
Kind of an overlap question with the last one but are there any players that have like stood out uh like uh because of like something noteworthy they've done in the surfer or anything like that in your mind you know i have kind of a bad memory for that kind of thing so recent players who've done some pretty amazing things uh mawadi<br>
<br>
Who has an amazingly huge build of a detailed um called la cirque on earth can quickly work to that try to give us a page of scenery oh yeah we were here yesterday with yeah we were here yesterday and this is kind of one of my favorite places uh it's just there's it's just one of those places that<br>
<br>
Where you look at it and there's just such such such loving detail in every or such loving work in every detail um but they put quite a lot of effort into it when um 1.7 came out they uh uh created a whole bunch of they just spent a week re redecorating i thought it was kind of great it looks it looks beautiful yeah i love<br>
<br>
The end rods on the top there and like all the all the different plants and stuff yeah yeah she's yeah they've got a good eye yeah i i there there's just a ton of them there's uh serenada who has who made that that you can see from the server you know space the oh made the what i i'm sorry you<br>
<br>
Kind of iron side slash that's a kind of a large city middle of the map they've put a lot of work into um so in terms of people who've really stood out in a build uh those really hit the top of the list for me there's also jamie who's a recent build on this massive underground<br>
<br>
That i still haven't explored oh okay yeah what was the longest uh the server's longest uh downtime period if there wasn't i would say not more than a week like there was one time when we had a pretty bad disc failure and i had to pull pretty much everything i had to rebuild<br>
<br>
Pretty much every scratch like um restore the vms from backups oh when was that i would say a week is about the longest time uh when was the when was the failure oh 2016. actually i can tell you it's like april 4th 2016 because all of the time stamps and my files are that because when i restored it i lost all the timestamps for a bunch of things so how much was lost<br>
<br>
Um nothing in the minecraft server but on my personal like utility server which hosts uh dns and email and such um i lost a couple of user accounts because yeah yeah my personal maybe um because well the backup i only managed to restore like the top 80 of you accounts so like a through q were restored but everything past that<br>
<br>
Wasn't so my own account was fine but anyone who anyone whose username started the queue or higher was screwed so that was pretty good um oh that's upset that's probably annoying it was super annoying i had to leave some very nice apology notes um what part of running novolin is the most difficult i i was gonna say recruiting good people<br>
<br>
But honestly good people are pretty easy to find like i i i find that most players have have a really great attitude even the ones that seem like they just oh sorry you cut out there oh sorry i turned away<br>
<br>
The most difficult part of running i think just finding the personal uh motivation to do things has always been a challenge for me like um you know you have to do something it's easy to do it you just have to actually and yeah i i really struggle with that i'm pretty fundamentally lazy well i i can kind of relate to that this is part of a reason i found your<br>
<br>
Server and like a year later i made a video on it yeah i remember we talked about a free fleet accident and that was when you still had the portal of this the split gate plug-in oh the wormholes yeah that's the gate i really missed those well you know what maybe we can get somebody to like update the plugin fingers crossed a few people have taken<br>
<br>
Um well i think if any any of the any of the videos that come out on the server actually go off pop off you'll probably find someone able to do it and willing to do it potentially it's an amazing plugin it's a point-to-point teleportation system with kind of a neat little bush animation when you activate a start and it's lucky enough to use a few<br>
<br>
It's just thematically fun and i i've always had it i've always had a problem with command based mechanics like i i absolutely hate warp commands they're silly they're they're not they're not gameplay motivated they're just magic incantations uh i i really like things like runecraft for instance that have an in-game component that<br>
<br>
Has an in-game effect you're not just typing in word in the slash command and the the stargate of wormhole extreme the name of the plugin i've kind of had exactly what i wanted in a teleport plugin i see well um yeah i uh i will try and see if i can find someone to help with the plug-in thing later um yeah<br>
<br>
It's a bit of a challenge because the database is stored as kind of a binary blob instead of any kind of standard sql format uh so importing the data is right off the bat we had to jump through some hoops to get the get out and uh the um author of the plugin itself has been struggling with uh something about the magic number<br>
<br>
Is my services and uh porting the data forward has been a challenge i see yeah it's i don't i don't wanna i don't wanna size it's fair enough fair enough he's a nice guy you don't wanna put too much pressure on oh of course of course not uh<br>
<br>
Yeah okay um yeah this is kind of a bit of a of a bit of a sharp turn but um like what is like uh would you ever consider selling the server to someone um i i would consider giving it away to somebody who would prop who would maintain it and take care of it<br>
<br>
It's like would you sell your cat to somebody yeah you know like uh i i i i would like to see it taken care of hypothetically like if hypothetically i got totally sick and i couldn't couldn't bear to look at it anymore i'd at least want somebody to properly take care of it and i hate to use words like vision but execute my vision of what it should be like i've always wanted a server that i<br>
<br>
Would want to play on you know yeah and yeah and not like not pay to win for instance i i have a pretty strong opinion on that um i've always been against people paying for gameplay advantages so um like i do have a donation based membership system but that will never give you any kind of free loot or<br>
<br>
It'll give you a privilege like you can sign in ahead of other people or you get a special hat sign sign in where oh sorry i mean like oh just hypothetically hypothetically we were talking about what happens if we suddenly get like a hundred players wanting to come once what happens to people who've donated and i was saying you know what you can just bump ahead of the queue of anyone else who isn't a<br>
<br>
Paid member all right and that would be my idea of a good yeah that sounds fair i think that sounds like far superior to like what a server like 2b2t has set up currently oh what do they have set up yeah they have a queue system um due to the number of people who want to play it's like it's like like four plus hours long and then you can pay for a monthly<br>
<br>
Subscription of 20 bucks to go into a shorter queue that's about like occasionally up to an hour long which and it's just like it's not like instant access to the server either it's like delayed shorter cue skip kind of and yeah it's not like you can't do any one-time payments for that kind of deal right it sounds like they're a victim of their own success oh yeah oh yeah but they're also they're partly where<br>
<br>
They're like they kind of need the money from the serve from that queue so they they're not incentivized to remove it uh or make it like more fair and like easier for people to get in and out um yeah so they don't keep it the same it sounds like an unpleasant experience of a player oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah yeah there's a lot of complaints with that server that's part of why a lot of<br>
<br>
People quit playing it that in the community but then that's two different two different uh problems uh yes we kind of really discussed this we don't have to go too in depth on this one but like under what circumstances would you stop running the server um i suppose health reasons would top the best um if i suddenly had to dramatically cut my<br>
<br>
Expenses i can't see that happen in the future but if you know if i was suddenly horse and couldn't spare the internet bill but uh you know sudden speed of mental illness really health issues in general i said and in that case i'd probably try to hand it off to someone's um because<br>
<br>
Like the serger the server hardware is paid for and the internet bill ultimate that much it's just like a residential shaw cable connection uh the [Music] monthly cost of that highs unless things break so i could just hand it to somebody with the reasonable linux skills and say go to town just keep it<br>
<br>
Working nice and i have a few people in mind who who could all right um so if i was hit by a bus the server would probably still muddle along for a while at least oh that's good you've got you've got contingent contingency plans yeah yeah so if i die you've got a few months at least oh boy getting morbid there she shouldn't be thinking about those<br>
<br>
Things until until you're at least at least 70. being a system administrator means you have to kind of i mean you have to have three sets of backups off-site website and live copy you're really taking the like this is like practice for like work and stuff real real real dedicated like yep yeah there's some professional pride<br>
<br>
Involved here you know what you want to do a good job oh wow yeah um kind of loop it back to the start of the server uh why did you choose the the genre of server that you did you got you went with and like smp huh it was the easiest i mean um i wanted to run a multiplayer server just because that was the that was the<br>
<br>
New hotness at the time and i had i had run multiplayer servers in the past like i had written a series of the classic creative ones if you're for those yeah oh the classic like 2009 error yeah all right yeah back when not the the first test of a minecraft multiplayer the ones in a web browser uh yes wow in fact i still have that<br>
<br>
Still have one of the servers i still have one of those old maps in inquiry uh wow if i can teleport you across servers probably not if you do slash spawn and go through the creative portal creative plot world i got you all right yeah there you go you just joined the game hooray tp so this was my pre-insta game and a bunch of people<br>
<br>
Played on this this old server and i managed to extract the map from the um server.dat and copied it into my plot world when did you when did you copy it over um fairly recently a few years ago but uh this map dates back to 2008-2009 wow that is that's crazy and and you'll you'll see it looks like it is basically your standards um classic creative map<br>
<br>
A lot of a lot of bedrock here so you've got wow this is this is some this is some basically some minecraft histories and like i like oh gee like all the older than the main server stuff this is emoji og classic minecraft yeah damn that's awesome yeah so much time spent fixing so much time spent uh fixing one fixing griefing here oh oh did that happen a lot like is that why there's so much<br>
<br>
Bedrock in like one corner of the map well my theory was kind of wall players off on one side until they've been through some kind of vetting process so the side of the map looks a lot the other side of the bedrock wall looks a lot oh i said and then i could theoretically just kind of port them over once they've proved themselves to be<br>
<br>
Not complete once they're they've proven themselves to be worthy worthy but this is an example like this is kind of what it would look like uh classic yeah yeah well that's that's really awesome i feel privileged to to view this with my own eyes it's crazy i like the spider thing oh wait is that is that from uh a show or something like that<br>
<br>
Um i feel if it's a reference i don't know i don't know it just like mildly reminded me of something from uh on uh the show but i i realized the original thing did not have laser guns yeah my partner just laughed at me across the she actually used to play with me on this map like she actually made this little<br>
<br>
Garden here oh i can't actually see you by the way here in the oh i am invisible to other players um yeah there you are so i'm standing on this little causeway little garden here and it's really quite oh wow yeah look at that i think the trees were built by hand i guess they didn't have<br>
<br>
Naturally generating trees back in the day um i do think these these had to open do yeah blend you know there were there were definitely trees in the map generally yeah if you look down there it's right there i just uh yeah it's not that old i'm i don't know i don't even know if they were sapples at the time so these trees up here in<br>
<br>
The garden would have hand built but those trees may or may not have been planted it's too long ago i can't remember fair enough fair enough um uh what's your favorite version of minecraft yeah hmm i would have to say it peaked maybe 1.12.13<br>
<br>
Because right around that point they started a ton of kind of useless blocks or cosmetic blocks that really didn't have any special purpose and just more surf to add confusion building possibilities like do you really need six different colors of wood i mean i guess i guess if you're really artistic you can do some cool things with it yeah but gameplay-wise i don't know if it really<br>
<br>
Mm-hmm so if you're if you're if you're into pixel art yay different colors but yeah like for uh for the average like that that has been a complaint as of recent with uh them they add a lot more fluff instead of building on the base game like i'd like i i like it when they add new mechanics to add complexity<br>
<br>
And uh that's i'm really looking forward to cave updates that that's a strong contender for my new favorite update i actually played a little bit and i haven't been that terrified playing minecraft did they really bring back the fear from baby they really brought back the fear and so i have to hand it to them that's exciting i i want to play that now i have not i've been avoiding<br>
<br>
Anything about new updates just because i i can't be bothered it's hard to get excited about yeah you get a little jaded it's like oh 50 update 1.15 i get i get b's now thanks yeah i mean the bees are cute and all they yeah they are but it's like what are you gonna do with them yeah they're gonna buzz around and then you're going to do something else<br>
<br>
Yeah but a couple of weeks ago the first time i cracked open into one of those giant underground caverns and yeah i just i actually i genuinely got that stomach dropping looking down from a height that's crazy yeah like the all the new underground stuff as well that's just i'm genuinely impressed they've got some great art direction happening there<br>
<br>
Um yeah in terms of favorite version uh the case version could be my favorite version so we'll see awesome uh yeah for uh like we kind of touched on this a little bit earlier like the runes plug-in um it's just like why why why is that on the server why are there like not 100 vanilla like plug-ins that are<br>
<br>
Added yeah uh runecraft i was against it for a while because it adds some kind of i feel what are overpowered mechanics and i still feel they're overpowered like power pick roon for instance gives you the ability to enchant a standard pick with something that destroys three by three by three cube<br>
<br>
Of touring and it's it's a little much um and but it also adds some really fun gameplay mechanics that i think others really enjoy um and and it has i was talking earlier about in-game mechanics having in-game effects yeah<br>
<br>
Runecraft allows you to draw patterns of blocks that have effects in the world and uh it's just it's just so much it's just fun you can create teleporters that allow you to go from point to point um there's there's really simple things like the compass room tells you which way<br>
<br>
And some crazy ones that create or change the time oh that's why uh that riley guy o'reilly castle is able to change the time of day so much so are they like built in the world or are they like an item that gets created after you build them they're built in the world you draw a pattern of blocks and then you activate clicking in the center<br>
<br>
And it either modifies the blocks in in situ or it creates or it put applies in enchantment i said okay yeah we didn't have it for quite a while because it broke so um what's that but now you have it back but now we have it back and especially with<br>
<br>
The breaking of the stargate plug-in we needed some kind of teleport plug-in that wasn't slash warp yeah that one really worked it happened to be and it's been one of the plug-ins that's maintained itself over the years so it it it could have broke but it somehow has been kept maintained by its author which i had my<br>
<br>
Yeah yeah this takes a lot of dedication um is one of those plugins that's been around since the beginning like it's almost as old as as i have playing minecraft well so it's like it's like the same age as your server basically it's little bit yeah well that's crazy like like you you can find runecraft portals dating back to like second spawn and third spawn where people<br>
<br>
Drawn clear patterns in the ground that are intended to be teleport pads that's that's crazy because yeah that's one thing on here it's like you won't see this on like novalin or anything like that i'm not know minecraft online or something but if you go through the map it's like there's like clear evidence of old like plug-ins and old like old mostly yeah just different types of old plugins like the stargate stuff or<br>
<br>
The like even that you had like a biome a sky biomes plug-in yeah i pasted that in a while back if you paste it in or did you like i did i didn't change the terrain generation or anything i found like a a floating island at uh y equal stood in again at an offset at like y equals 64. so we had two layers of so that's just like uh that was just uh<br>
<br>
When did you add that in oh uh i want to say a couple after the server started it was an ongoing project um so it would have to be like 2012 2011 oh that's really cool yeah um so that one i thought was generated by a plug-in around in the beta brand beta times but um that's like something you<br>
<br>
World edited in to create that's cool somebody else created and i pasted it oh yeah and then i cleaned it up around the edges to look a little more rated and if you look at the giant pitch there where i've pasted it you can see like a point where it was pasted in yeah like where i've tried to smooth out the edges oh yeah like i've noticed that there's a bit of like world uh world uh like a<br>
<br>
Chunk border buffing there's a lot of that yeah the terrain generation has changed a lot yeah yeah um what's like the most notable or like cool thing that's been done on nfl in your opinion um cool can mean a bunch of things because some people have done some crazy stuff<br>
<br>
Like there's this one guy who dug like a 200 by 200 pin just nothing but a giant ground he took out one block at a time by hand that cool like crazy that's kind of both what's the biggest the one where you've what you've got like the best thing where you you go and you you look at it and you go wow that's cool like but then like the you know you get that feeling with a lot of things right i'm sure especially on<br>
<br>
Here but like what was the one where you're like that is the most notable one that sticks out in my brain um well that would have to be iron sights it's the city that sarah nodded some time ago serenada and uh the friend or brother or something i don't recall okay we can yeah let's let's go to it um real quick okay<br>
<br>
All right now we're cooking wow yeah this is this is a huge city this is yeah i'm genuinely impressed by this build he built a good chunk of it by hand in in survival mode mining all of the blocks after a while watching him do that and struggling with it i kind of took video and gave him creative mode for a lot of it and he's been going absolutely to town<br>
<br>
That's awesome very creative builder oh yeah look at all you can really see the like hallmarks of like a old build too when was this started a long tour i couldn't tell you i'm sorry many years many years i mean it definitely looks like it's many years old just with all the cobblestone like you don't see a lot of uh giant cities that are uh<br>
<br>
That are built with cobblestone as the base of the material most of the time it's like stone or yeah you know not with slabs and like this is like the old block usage you know a limited block yeah yeah it's a little old last year and there's like fighter jets in the sky too that's awesome oh there we go um if you fly around a little you'll see more recent blocks like uh as you travel<br>
<br>
Out oh yeah the block styles change and types change and he's kind of retrieved retrofitted a few buildings to have new rocks like i think his most recent project was to change all the to use this new style deep slate yeah the roads do look like much more like roads with the deep slit yeah this was cobbled as recently as last month they've been going around fixing that<br>
<br>
Um so it's kind of nice to see somebody uh update it to try and make it as good as nice oh yeah absolutely he's like got that dedication to retroactively fit all this yeah and if anything that's even more oh yeah i'm way more tedious than you know creatively making something new too there's like all sorts of little easter eggs in the city yeah they'll have at one point there's a a lobby with some<br>
<br>
Guard dogs i'm sorry you cut out there's a room with guard dogs in it yeah um he he likes to put in the trick he likes like we got a bit of us like a story or like a like world kind of going on you know to make it look lived yeah but you asked me what i personally find<br>
<br>
Most impressive uh this guy's been around for five six years and has done some pretty cool stuff and this is just one of his two he's got an oil rig somewhere a giant floating aircraft carrier oh that's all the um actually we can visit too uh what's it called oh paragon oh i think i i visited that one yesterday yeah um yeah and and he built most of that by hand i think the only<br>
<br>
Thing uh what was the only thing that um oh i at one point i took a good chunk of it and mirrored it to the other half you uh you had like one chunk of it and it just kind of mirrored it helped him get out the corners right get the details right so that it was correctly aligned they're very interesting um<br>
<br>
Climbing to the top of this thing yeah teleport again there you go this yeah i i i really didn't get grab a scope of this thing while i was well i was uh trying to figure out how to get on the roof but holy cow yeah this is oh this reminds us this is like one of those like uh sets for like a movie or something like an aircraft carrier like<br>
<br>
Hugh you know that uh what is the thing that that flies in the sky in the one of those marvel movies it looks like that but it's in the water this is huge this just looks like i guess you could say it's good to the scale of a real one not a movie set what am i talking about all those little support ships around the aircraft carrier he's got um state rooms that park<br>
<br>
And there's a lot to explore it's fun in fact at one point he built a um uh aircraft carriers have an actual elevator for planes and a runway to spit them up onto so uh you call them here somewhere for air for uh aircraft to be lifted out of storage bay and onto the oh there it is yeah i'm looking at one right now cool uh yeah some of these fighter jets are<br>
<br>
Not claimed by the land claim just let you know oh well that's good to know um yeah oh and look at the like smoke on the back of this thing yeah you know nobody comes out here i'm just going to expand region by 50 blocks there's lots of glow squids there we go and the propeller probably not going to affect anybody oh yeah and if it does<br>
<br>
You'll probably know pretty quickly people are pretty good about complaining yeah and that's what i've noticed that people are uh that's all they're really good at sometimes it can feel like i mean if nobody complains broken right oh yeah that's true how do you know um there you are again um well you're hosting the server you're still hosting it but like during your<br>
<br>
Time of this the course of these like over 10 years what's the what's the like biggest mistake you've made while doing it hmm well i've i've i've i have deleted the map a couple of times like actually fully wiped it out and had to restore from backup i mean that's a mistake but it's a recoverable mistake there's been a couple of catastrophic<br>
<br>
And oh this isn't a mistake that i made but one of the moderators um accidentally set coordinates for a world did it wrong and accidentally rolled it into trench like eight kilometers long and there's still a couple of pieces of that that weren't repaired uh we couldn't quite fix it like there's only so far that undo can take you with let it rain<br>
<br>
Yeah wow so that was pretty great um oh what else i haven't had any security disclosures like i haven't had any data leaked or no that's good it's doing better than facebook yeah fingers crossed yeah if you gave me more time to think about it i could probably probably come<br>
<br>
Up with something but off the top of my head those are kind of the worst thing okay so like really nothing all that that horrible that's that's a pretty good track record oh one time i was transitioning from a temporary map back into the permanent map and i had con you i i had because to because<br>
<br>
I i usually create a temporary map and then i validate all the plugins to make sure everything's working yeah um so i had copied all of the plugins from the temporary map to the new map and then i had done then then we had a griefer and i did a rollback in a certain area but the rollback had been done against the old map not the actual permanent map so it it<br>
<br>
Messed up a ton of terrain because all it i did a vlog i did a uh log what's called a roll uh excuse me gather your words it's fine um log block and other block protection plugins can keep a record of what players have done over a per time and you can undo or redo a player's<br>
<br>
Entire set of that time now what happens if you take a player's actions on one map and replay that log on another map suddenly like somebody places a dirt block at cordon at a certain coordinates on one map and that's just you know a lake another nice and it just created a huge<br>
<br>
And that was that was definitely uh is there probably still some remnants of that or did you manage to reset that no i think we fully i i think i'm fully but only back up from the day before okay that's unfortunate the value of good backups i cannot underline yeah good backups running a minecraft server because you are gonna mess it up oh yeah i've done that a couple of times<br>
<br>
Myself yeah every time before i do anything like plug-in related i'm baker backup or any updates related i make a bike up as well but i don't do it every cut every day i just don't have the space for it online computer um well i do what are called incremental backups and uh you do a full backup every week like an entire snapshot and then every subsequent day for the next<br>
<br>
You only copy the files that change oh yeah and uh you can rebuild the state of the system and on any given from the incremental backups plus the back oh okay that's actually that's cool all right yeah i'm not very tech savvy unfortunately so like i have no idea how that like how i would<br>
<br>
Implement that myself but that's like uh it's neat i mean it never really occurred to me to do something like that yeah definitely save some somebody use a program called duplicity which um handles all of the details okay awesome um so we talked a bit about griefing earlier but like are there any like<br>
<br>
What's the most memorable uh incident of griefing and how did you what did it what happened during it and what did you do to fix it um the the most memorable griefs have to be the earliest ones like uh one guy went in the first couple of months of the server because we had built highways going to the four compass points from the spawn the original spawn point<br>
<br>
Uh he had uh spammed lava blocks among along several kilometers and uh you know you know how lava griefing works you drop a little splash you can't get rid of that stuff you can't get rid of that stuff it's everywhere there's still people there's still pieces today yeah you can still find little bits and pieces but i clean it up when i<br>
<br>
Find it so if you kind of look go if you go to the highway around first pond and then swim in the water underneath it you'll see like little bits of cobble here and along the highway yeah i know where you and there's just this one guy who did all of that it must have taken him hours yeah<br>
<br>
It's like some people are incredibly persis yeah there's like uh this kind of reminds me of like this the lengths people will go to on like the servers like anarchy servers to destroy something it's like sometimes there's just more effort put into destroying something than there was put into building it yeah it's it's it almost gets elevated<br>
<br>
To an art form oh yeah oh yeah you have to admire the sheer doggedness yeah uh ever since then we've just always had rollback and backup plug-in maybe more like respect the effort but not admire it don't condone running any kind of game server you have a an asymmetry problem because it's generally easier to destroy than okay so you have to be able to reverse that<br>
<br>
Asymmetry it always has to be to roll back grieving than it is to create because otherwise you'll drown will absolutely drown yeah yeah i agree with that it's one of that's one of the biggest flaws 2b has is they they just don't have a counter to griefing nothing is there's nothing that can combat it effectively yeah and they encourage him that's<br>
<br>
That's true i mean it's not like an exactly an issue but it's for like people who who visit the server for reasons that don't involve just you know to see things it's kind of it's disappointing on there yeah it's a little heartbreaking putting in so much effort into something and just watching some guy walk up with a torch although i'd say there's there's some<br>
<br>
It's it's it creates a different mindset when building something like for me personally like i need to know that if i go on a server and i build something really cool on there some guy can just come by and just nuke it like it just for me personally that makes me feel good yeah i just like if i know it's temporary you know like that's one thing griefing does to like a world it's like it as in an element of like erosion that<br>
<br>
Doesn't exist in like like normal minecraft which is like yeah i totally see that it has its pros and cons of course but um more cons than pros but you know there's like a life lesson in here about the fundamental impermanence of all yeah i am ozymandias king of kings look upon my works human despair it's just a very nihilistic message but<br>
<br>
Everything we make get destroyed that's just the way the world is yeah everything we create will crumble into dust and that's a fact of life and building that into your gameplay kind is kind of depressing but it's depressing but it's also kind of like like visionary yeah i mean you gotta learn to the impermanence of life in general oh yeah there's there's there are life lessons<br>
<br>
To be had there and if you can if you can cope with seeing your dirt shack bird uh destroyed in minecraft you can cope with a lot of life setbacks you know what you you pick up your and you move on and you build something it's also going to get destroyed but take a deep breath and move on oh yeah you got you get like into it like a zen about it kind of yeah yeah yeah totally all right like uh talking about um everything getting wiped and removed and<br>
<br>
Everything for not kind of uh kind of into like the opposite vein of that if you could start from the beginning what would you do differently hmm with all of your knowledge currently smaller map border smaller because players banded out really quickly really fast and it made the map very quickly on<br>
<br>
Uh players generated a ton of terrain very quickly because when you log into an infinite world what's the first thing you're going to do a lot of them expand yeah you're going to pick a direction and go you're just going to try to be as far away from people as possible and the people generated like the map was like six gigs within a year and i had to throw down a 20k<br>
<br>
How large is the map currently um inside in terms of gigabytes about 25 26. so it's not the largest by any means yeah that was kind of this same size as one of my old servers yeah i didn't enforce a map a map limit so we just like we generated chunks out into the millions yeah you try to i try to stop people from making useless terrain mm-hmm yeah<br>
<br>
Your render is very like uh has a lot of like unloaded chunks yeah there's there's quite a few places that people happen to get which is which is gratifying i've also reserved quite a bit of land by slapping down big world guard regions so as future content patches come out that requires terrain i'll just nip off a few of that and then and then i can reach great what uh um yeah so like is that what's your plan<br>
<br>
For when the when the map like uh when people generate everything inside the border put out the border i mean what else just expand it yeah um i do keep an eye out opportunity leading errors and i have to leave you if if there's an obvious or an obvious idea notice that actually i was looking at your render and i was like why does it look like this entire<br>
<br>
Section of the world has been like edited in separately but it's it's because the trunk borders are like a square but it's like that must be from you resetting parts of the world yeah i have absolutely destroyed that part of the world dealt with few complaints uh told um and regen regenerated the terrain yeah and so oh yeah you try not to delete<br>
<br>
Anybody's existing builds but i i've i've done a couple oh no r.i.p rip um yeah so like back to the the question of starting what would all over what would you do differently we didn't really answer that i don't know if i'd do much differently oh besides just make the maps shorter smaller yeah like i'd be a little more<br>
<br>
Conservative about letting people spread out i try and keep people like in recent patches i've tried to keep people closer together so that they can interact a little more because if people spread out they're not really talking to each other in the early maps people tended to congregate more but now they tend to build all little castles and uh have<br>
<br>
Their own little victims i i kind of miss the fact that people had towns back in the day and they don't really do that but maybe that's an artifact of just not having as many i think so i think that'll change and i've i have a small feeling that over the next coming months that's going to change yeah yeah if we get a good influx of players i could see people cooperating more that's for sure<br>
<br>
Uh what is your advice for aspiring minecraft server owners um well keep good backups for sure and listen to your players they they're not dumb they know what they want and [Music] maybe don't give them everything they but<br>
<br>
Try to listen past what they're actually saying to what they actually need like what what a player wants is not necessarily what they need i but what they're saying is they want a path stuff that that's right you got to make that like part of the the experience engaging again you know you got it yeah just might so difficult health has been<br>
<br>
Struggling with making that aging oh yeah i think there's a new update though we could change that yeah to let a lot of content i'm i'm looking forward to seeing the underground cities oh yeah oh yeah and they're going to be like over the current chunks of the in the server right now oh yeah that's going to be nutty you'll have people like going to the beta<br>
<br>
Terrain and in dev terrain and just building a hat like an entire like city underneath there yeah at a stroke they've doubled the amount of usable space in them which is just gonna be great that'll add to map density too yeah but that's yeah you'll be able to have like layered builds and stuff way more than what we currently have yeah and it'll be kind of neat to see<br>
<br>
People coming back to roll just dig down to it again more more basement sellers less skyscrapers ah yeah oh well uh if it keeps people interested i suppose it's uh it's worth it what's the uh people having fun yeah as long as people are having fun it's all it's all good what's the i uh like speaking of players<br>
<br>
And listening to them and whatnot it's like what's the ideal player uh for in your mind who would like play your server hmm someone i'm someone who's a good conversationalist and um someone who gives a good feedback hmm i don't know there's so many different types of people you want to<br>
<br>
Have around and everybody's everybody's unique and offers their own perspective i like goodyear okay um well then on like a a mirror question what's like the the opposite of an ideal player what's what's the worst possible person you could have join your server and that you would immediately go no go away leave ban banned gone<br>
<br>
What are what are some big red flags for you how about an indie player well edge lords anybody who's trying to provoke a reaction hmm list um yeah people who are constantly complaining and there's good complaining about complaining there's whining yeah so i won't really<br>
<br>
Uh kind of my favorite players will bring maturity and uh people who de-escalate conflict people who escalate conflict are my favorite people who can calm down the situation uh there are the people who do who escalate conflict are your least favorite kind<br>
<br>
Yeah and you know the kind of person i'm talking oh yeah the drop of a hat and they'll interpret everything somebody says worst possible oh yeah unfortunately i don't think those people very well that's true yeah they need they need more excitement um than like a slow burn<br>
<br>
Yeah yeah if you just kind of approach them with for instance most of the time with indifference yes um i i'd like to talk about the uh the the like uh the old uh version of hell in like minecraft nether that's underneath the map i found that yesterday with some a guy or i was told about it that is so cool<br>
<br>
Like can you tell me about that a little bit um okay yeah yeah if well i forget what the warp name is but hey that was wandering around there that is one cool ass place it even has like like generation for uh it even has like uh mobs that uh from the version like like pigment and stuff that spawns it's it's it's not it's a block of water it's not as complicated as story um i took<br>
<br>
An ex well i was telling you about the floating island map that i paced above the ground yeah this is the same map but i've placed underground so a bunch of floating island below ground level and added a bedrock and then and then pasted in a bunch of lava or added a<br>
<br>
In fact if you really looked closely at it the original island were in dev terrain and that somebody like i didn't create the island map that if someone else made the island mapping you you modified it and remnants of it that you can tell like the trees i'm guessing yeah yeah you can see bits and pieces i over time i've kind of changed it i<br>
<br>
Converted like a lot of the sand i converted to solstice blocks and a lot of the dirt i converted to etherstones um i did some overlay to convert various blocks into other blocks dropped a whole bunch of sand added lava i see is this um in biome like inspired by the nether or by like the og like hell world inf dev kind of<br>
<br>
Dude i don't remember the hell world from infdev to be honest okay um but this is an actual biome like i've yeah you've switched it to nether i've noticed that yeah yeah if you hit f3 that means that if uh that means you won't be able to place water down here right oh really is that a thing i don't know it doesn't mean that because it's if it's considered another biome<br>
<br>
I got i got you covered oh never mind i'm wrong you can place it is water flow turned off on here um yes if you do slash rg info play so water flow did not yep look like i don't remember the motivation for that probably to keep people from turning<br>
<br>
Lava too yeah i think i noticed a little bit of it that was turned into like down here a little bit uh looks like someone was getting did you do this or did it was someone like filling this in there's a piece of bedrock just here oh who knows where that came there was actually a bug a while back with log block the plugin used to use bedrock as uh<br>
<br>
As a tool and under some circumstance with a piece of bedrock inventory and a couple of player actual stacks of rock probably left over that's cool if you've discovered those players would you remove those bedrock pieces from them or what i don't know i i would remove them when i find them but i i i tend to turn a blind eye towards<br>
<br>
Certain exploits as they're pretty harmless for the most part i see i mean if if a player isn't being a jerk it's about stuff like getting their hands on bedrock they're not going around spawn covering every single thing and exactly you're they're being responsible for it with that they're just having fun with not causing problems whatever they can have their their bedrock blocks and<br>
<br>
One of the challenges of running your server is that players will have old stuff that they've received as a result of bugs or mistakes by the administrator um like i've for instance a while back i set um eggs to drop from mobs like a creeper had a one percent drugs dropping a creeper egg so of<br>
<br>
Course people built farms for careers and there's a few people with still a few stacks of creepering that's crazy you know what it's fine yeah i mean as long as like creepers don't even do block damage anymore so yeah yeah i turned that off it's just completely insane yeah for a long term map creepers are critically extreme especially the superpowers<br>
<br>
Yeah the need f any kind of long-term map pretty much has to turn off creepers because you'll just end up with the craters yeah well it depends on like the goal for the long-term map right that's true yeah like i know a few servers like 2b or sim pvp uh where they just they just the goal is to just have like basically a giant world that just is on mostly unregulated right<br>
<br>
And the chaos is the point oh yeah yeah yeah uh with the with the new and upcoming publicity that uh the youtuber scene is uh going to probably bring uh what are your what are your plans yeah what do you what are your plans to either capitalize<br>
<br>
On and or just for the surfer in general in the future regardless of players i will probably raise the player cap marginally maybe up to 20 or so and i'll bring on a couple more moderate can't systematically extending the player cap because i cannot my brain cannot handle large and i really prefer the smaller so i i figure if<br>
<br>
If and when we get a huge amount of exposure i um figured we'll just ride it out until until the ice dines down until the hype dies down and we get like a core of repeated players i gotcha gotcha you don't want it to be too crazy yeah fair enough and it's like yeah that means like a lot of stuff like uh the the terrain that in like let's say the older versions with all those like<br>
<br>
Corrupted trees that'll start to dwindle when new players join and maybe mine those more and other other things right other like relatively other like smaller builds that aren't claimed might get built over or destroyed just over the course like even not like maliciously just as time goes on yeah it's unfortunate and you protect what you can you know life goes on yeah like<br>
<br>
Like when it comes to let's say art restoration you can't save everything right so you just you give the impression of of everything more than the individual and i've never been too focused on protecting every little shack that's yeah 20. like uh that's like kind of the entire opposite of what minecraft online does they have like a<br>
<br>
A hyper like focused mod team they have got like a plugin that says whenever a block is broken and if it's broken by who and if if someone because they don't have a land claim plug-in they have a land tells you what's being broken plug-in and if you break a block any block that is not placed by you it tells the mods they teleport behind you and they start like angrily asking you why are you griefing the<br>
<br>
Server what are you doing and then and then if you go uh i just played i just broke a block dude i put it back they ban you that's not even a joke either um i mean if you don't immediately go i'm sorry i'm sorry there was a complete accident don't pay me please they will just remove you because they you know they don't have the patience for it and there's just too many people who come join that server all the time<br>
<br>
Yeah that explains something from a couple days ago actually terrified of borrowing somebody's horse that they found out in the plans oh yeah oh my god can i take this something going on me what's going to happen oh yeah because minecraft online is a president for the harshness with it come when it comes to enforcing rules they have like 30 000 player bands or something like that and with the<br>
<br>
Number of players they have i can kind of understand that because you kind of have to be authoritarian fascist or get away there's no like well there is a core community there but they have like a kind of like what you have but like way larger like 50 or 100 people and it's like almost i think it's international as well uh like different times of the day have<br>
<br>
Like different like people flying and stuff and they've got like different mod communities that like not mod communities but like different people who play at like different times right and they got to keep them all they got to stop them from breaking blocks and and this is one thing that i'd like to commend you on as well is that um you use like new plugins right you're what are you running paper paper<br>
<br>
Like that in fact i just upgraded it like yesterday yeah minecraft online runs like i think they run canary which is like a port of an old old old old uh i i yeah something like that uh operating system yeah and that it's part of why they've been like they're their server lag so much uh and also like um uh just like for their plugins aren't like very good because they they refuse to like switch to like a newer<br>
<br>
System i don't know exactly why maybe it's just hard to convert all that information but uh it's really like caused their number one cause for like server problems as far as lag so they're not taking advantage of yeah radically impressive developments in a server that's they were on 1.7 for like after 1.7 came out they stayed on it until until a few until seven months ago<br>
<br>
When they updated to 1.12 um and it's like like 1.12 i think is less laggy now but it's like they they they had before it took like you break a block and you'd wait like three seconds and then it would actually break yeah it was painful it's like an entirely different way to play the game i remember one of the one of the moderators or ex-moderators now um he's<br>
<br>
Mr bricks on server if you've recognized him he was telling me how he switched to playing a different server after he quit minecraft online or something and then he's just like it's like whoa i'm getting like weird ptsd from seeing a block that i break just break when i when i click it and i don't like wait and he's like i'm getting tripped up witchcraft yeah he's like everything is running so smoothly i've been like we used to like<br>
<br>
Got like this mental block expecting everything to be so slow and painful because he's been just used to that for so long um yeah there's like psychological experiments where you delay somebody's uh reaction time by by 100 milliseconds plus they develop some kind of psychosis i think i'm broken yeah you've just broken an entire<br>
<br>
Generation yeah um all right and we've we've got one last question for you here yeah um yeah we made it to the end of the giant list um do you see yourself still running the server in 10 years um yeah i think so i mean i've got a path for the next four<br>
<br>
Years at least with the current hardware i don't see myself replacing it for a while um so at least that okay and yeah for ten years is pretty reasonable it's dude dude i'm going to be in my 30s i mean how how how weird is that oh yeah that i mean i've only i'm young<br>
<br>
You don't you don't notice it right yeah it creeps up on you yeah that's what i've been holding excuse me while i work through or work through some existential dread there a little bit of a are you having a mid-life crisis it starts with this video this uh this interview your midlife crisis no no i'm pretty past life i've got like my five tests you're five teslas<br>
<br>
Yeah paid for by the med server oh yeah for the mad cash that the the donations from the server are breaking in for you exactly um but yeah 10 years is is well within my planning i mean i i i can realistically see 10 years being assuming minecraft is around 10 years from now i mean although these days microsoft has their<br>
<br>
Grubby little claws into minecraft and it's a multi-billion yeah franchise so uh uh minecraft isn't going away anytime soon yeah it's just does it stay good for ten years that's the yeah assuming minecraft itself doesn't totally jump um and and even then i'll probably i can it's all staying on an older version<br>
<br>
I mean like minecraft online is doing it did it for for with 1.7 2b2t is doing it with 1.12 if they've been stuck on that for four years or something like that yeah and we were on 1.13 for a couple years just because i couldn't be asked to deal with it well i got i got on the tail end of that um yeah i got to experience the the last working star gate uh plug i probably have the the last recorded video of<br>
<br>
Stargate plugins working that's very possible there's other servers that you probably not too many yeah i'd say that's probably like a rare rarely used plugin these days um yeah um well i yeah what oh sorry go ahead oh i don't know i was just uh saying it's a big pleasure to just be able to do this interview with you after uh having found this a year ago this is you<br>
<br>
Know what you've done here is like is amazing really i mean like they might seem a little bit monotonous and a lot of effort for you but like for someone like me to to just stumble across this dude you do it's like it is like one of the most amazing discoveries ever just the one of the main most amazing things to like exist for minecraft history like dude you've hit like uh the record for the oldest map like that's still running<br>
<br>
Um and i think i've heard a fair claim to that yeah i i think you have like the most definitive claim out of them all actually um and to have to be so like unknown like most of these servers have been found before and like i didn't know anymore existed actually um and to find one like this with a with a<br>
<br>
Map this well preserved too um and like with like an owner is like like as capable as you uh which is like it's not like not every place has got like a map every a backup happening every every week full and like a semi map back up every day yeah and then we've got the block rollbacks for and and big fighter but yeah so i'd just like to say thank you thank you for keeping the server up for for everyone uh to to just have it<br>
<br>
Exist and this is like a real relic it's basically like a museum almost uh yeah yeah i i i'd like to comment that big things are built brick by brick so uh when you're in the thick of it you don't necessarily but you're putting down a brick every day and uh it's like that bojack horseman episode oh i love you guys do it every day<br>
<br>
Oh yeah it's like it's like yeah like what you're saying it's build something huge but and if you just do a small thing every day eventually you look back and it's this giant edifice yeah because it's like when you start the server right you don't you didn't see yourself running it for the next like decade right it's like yeah this is fun sure we'll just keep on doing yeah<br>
<br>
Well i think that's a great note 10 this all off on and uh thank you uh do you have do you have any last words for like uh any anybody watching um stay in school kids i don't know don't do drugs don't do drugs don't walk the crooked road or or only do the good drugs make sure to make sure to validate the quality of your drugs and the source of<br>
<br>
Your drugs before you do them all right okay come on top 10 list what are the top 10 good drugs um i have no opinion i know you have an opinion you just don't want to say i make a really good apple cider all right uh thank you and uh i'll talk to you at a later point yeah pleasure to talk to you have a good day [Music]<br>
<br>
All righty you did it you made it an hour and 45 minutes of beautiful beautiful interview footage and video and questions and and knowledge being dispensed you made it to the end i feel like if you've made it this far you might be one of those people who would be interested in financially supporting novalin um you know you know for the future<br>
<br>
So i have uh i have a i have a donation link uh well i have the server's donation link uh available in the description as well as on screen right now uh so if you want to go donate support the server financially uh maybe keep it help keep it running or update plugins somehow you can all do that as well as you know a link to the discord server and the ip to the actual server as well as the<br>
<br>
Website will all be in the description just uh yeah check out the server for yourself i hope i hope you enjoyed watching this video and interview uh with our boss as much as i had fun filming and uh editing it in post not that there was much editing needed uh and yes if you if you if you want to see more videos uh just subscribe to the channel<br>
<br>

<br>
Minecraft online a server running the same map that has never been reset for over 11 years which began the day minecraft survival multiplayer was officially released at this point players thought that was it a server which began on the same day minecraft multiplayer was released there can't be any older however another lesser known server nerd.new was discovered found have been running since june the 10th 2009 before<br>
<br>
Minecraft even had survival mode in its older classic creative multiplayer however nerd.nu had reset its map multiple times over the years and as such was no longer using the same map which it began with such as how minecraft online had therefore many players still considered minecraft online to be the oldest server as it had the oldest running minecraft world with immense history until now recently only about a week ago<br>
<br>
Another server was discovered completely hidden from the internet with only four videos total coming up on youtube upon doing a basic search a server which has also been running since minecraft survival multiplayer released on august 4th 2010 rivaling the age of minecraft online a server with a tiny community of active players who are still active in playing 10 years later a minecraft server which has an older map than minecraft online beginning before even<br>
<br>
Minecraft multiplayer was released publicly today we'll be talking about novella and its immense history this video is a special one so be sure to subscribe if you enjoy no pressure on november the 28th small youtuber saplo released a video titled minecraft's oldest unknown server i found the server by i like i'd spend a lot of time and i did spend like a lot of time looking through the archives essentially<br>
<br>
What i was like okay i want to find an old minecraft server saplo had an interest in old minecraft servers and had been searching for older servers on old web pages only accessible through the internet archive otherwise known as the wayback machine so i went to the serverless sites and i just went 2010. that's the uh that's the day i'm going back to he would scour these old minecraft server listing pages many of which had ceased to exist long ago and<br>
<br>
Like i didn't go on the actual site's current day sites and look up 2010 servers because i was like there's too many new servers you're not going to find those anyone who could find them there would have already done it so i went on the back machine i was thinking someone already would have had that done but all of the pages there have been untouched by anyone and i was the only first person to ever go through looking for 2010 servers on september<br>
<br>
The 31st 2020 he found something uh i'm thinking it went through like roughly like 5 000 ip addresses an old capture of the minecraft forum server listing section from august 14 2010 not even two weeks after survival multiplayer was released here was a list of servers submitted by users ordered by the last time they were seen online i did way more like after i found the server i was like well there's got to be more so i just kept searching and i was right i<br>
<br>
Found a lot more amongst the sea of servers lost to time lay novolen a dedicated server with a large existing map with random stuff to be found and regular backups of course googling novolen doesn't really give that many results there is a simple website with a web map viewer as we'll get to later and the website also displays the service plugins or features and a few of its custom recipes and a brief history there also exists a few<br>
<br>
Listings on minecraft server sites many of which are hidden due to the server's tiny player base besides that there are a handful of posts on reddit the minecraft forums and planet minecraft many of which are years old and got minimal attention heading to youtube now and besides zaplo's video doing a simple search only reveals four videos which combined don't even have 1 000 views total with the most recent being from three years ago yeah i mounted monitored<br>
<br>
It for an entire year dude i saw two people online at the same time once is that it or maybe it was three people it's like it never goes above three at online at one time like i remember it clearly there were more than two people online one time and i was like yep that's the most i've ever seen online and then it never happened again and that's been a year before saplo's video the server was only averaging one to three players online at best and their<br>
<br>
Discord server only had about 70 people in it it was a tiny community which had lasted over a decade the founder and server operator are boss rayuka or rob as we'll refer to him as has been running the server since its inception but what makes novelland so unique is that their map is even older than the server itself rob originally used this map as a single player world meaning much of the terrain near the original spawn was generated<br>
<br>
Before the server went online in fact much of the early terrain was generated even before alpha in minecraft infdev when multiplayer released he decided to take his single player world and use it as a world for the server meaning this world is even older than minecraft online's world and is likely the oldest running minecraft world in existence rob told me he created the map on april the 9th 2010 about 4 months before minecraft survival multiplayer was<br>
<br>
Released and the server went online the version the map was originally generated in was inf dev 2010413 what makes novellan's map so interesting is that rob liked to experiment with various plugins especially world edits creating interesting and unique terrain and structures on the server we walked a couple hundred blocks from spawn one and stumbled upon floating island terrain generation which rob mentioned was from<br>
<br>
An old adventure map made for minecraft classic which rob copied and pasted into the game because why not it has long since been abandoned however this is a common theme across the server unique and interesting builds have been built abandoned and left to age over time while exploring i also found items on the ground from where it seemed the player had died it's likely that these items may have been sitting in unloaded chunks for years just waiting for<br>
<br>
Somebody to stumble across them because the server is so small builds and bases are nicely dispersed around the map and you could be exploring what you perceive to be the wilderness only to stumble upon a base built half a dozen if not more years ago what i'm trying to say is that the server does not feel like a museum minecraft online is a great server but due to its immense popularity you have to go out thousands of blocks to build a base and are tightly<br>
<br>
Monitored to ensure not even a single torch is broken in older areas novolin doesn't feel like this at all and feels like a survival server straight out of 2011 with various old bases coupled with a vast and open space for players to build right nearby mobs still spawn in high frequency and threaten you there is basically zero lag it feels like it never strayed from its survival routes there is an almost endless list of cool builds from simple decade old houses to<br>
<br>
Massive cities and recreations of famous and recognizable things there's an awesome map viewer on the official website which not only displays a bird's eye view of the entire map but also has markers displaying the build's name and where warps are so you can hop on the server and easily go to it because there are so many builds i talk about a few of the most major which have some interesting backstories as well as some of the oldest which predate the server's<br>
<br>
Release the citadel is one of the oldest builds on the server built by rob back in inf dev before the server was even in multiplayer a large box-shaped fortress which towers high above the land around it rob was kind enough to send me a save of the world from inf dev so we can compare what some of his oldest builds look like then and now the citadel has a nice garden area within its walls as well as a moat coated with furnaces ironside is a famous stone city built by<br>
<br>
A single player over the span of five years on and off i personally like the jets the most in this build and just for fun they copied and pasted the entire city and blew it up as well warping to dog star reveals two massive star destroyers from star wars who entirely from stone oh and if you're wondering what's with all the oddly shaped obsidian portals found all around the map this was from a plugin called stargate which allowed players to walk<br>
<br>
Into portals and teleport to specific locations a plug-in would stop being updated in your minecraft versions this right here is another one of rob's earlier spaces but before the server was even a thing rob also built this tower nearby which he used to find his way around the map and prevent him from getting lost the trees all around the map also looked strange as back when this terrain was generated only one type of leaf block existed and three updates<br>
<br>
With the addition of new leaves there was a bug which caused current tree leaves to get replaced and will look quite funky here's another one of rob's earlier spaces built in the middle of a river rob would use these old style torch locks to prevent the sand from falling and leading water into the base paragon is one of the largest bases on the server supposedly built seven to eight years ago with some players stating it may have been built in 2010<br>
<br>
The insides are like a maze and really give off that old-style base fill however what's cool is that if you head to the top of the base you'll realize that you've been in a massive aircraft carrier surrounded by aircrafts the base was originally built in a tiny lake but rob moved it to a massive ocean lesserk is one of the more modern looking bases which truly looks astonishing straight out of a fantasy land just goes to show that you can also find a variety of<br>
<br>
Modern builds on the server especially around the newer spawns speaking of which the server has 13 spawns normally added when there is a new major update to the game you can see them on the map and warped to them in-game of course one spawn is a server's first spawn which was already generated by rob in single player meaning its terrain is from infidel versions here you will find many of the older spaces but all the way back in the server's earliest days<br>
<br>
But what would an 11 year old minecraft server be without his community what's so great about novolin is the fact that it has had a tight knit community for so long i decided to speak with long time player and moderator dog rafi and ask him about the experiences he has had on the server while we tour many older towns from 2010 to 2011 which have long since been abandoned uh my name is dorgraphy yeah i've been playing for like 11 years now 10 years<br>
<br>
Maybe wow i was 11 when i started i'm 22 now dography has been playing on the server since early 2011. and when he first joined he hadn't even played single-player minecraft before meaning this server was his very first experience with the game so um how did you actually find the server in the first place my friend told me about it at soccer practice one night all right okay and um we just joined and<br>
<br>
He'd been playing for like a month previous to me maybe he had some friends on here as well so there's a there's a big group of us like australians that play on here now so this is my this is the dude who introduced me his house and he said you can live in the basement so i lived in the basement for a bit all right this is like my very first house just moved in yeah literally this would have been yet<br>
<br>
Ten plus years ago it was like the first server i ever joined and i pretty much haven't played any other ones seriously since apart from like you know friends hosting of course as you can see my building skill is just unrivaled um and this is literally like where i spent like four weeks somehow so when was the server actually i'm most active well i<br>
<br>
Would say yeah like when i joined it was pretty active it really peaked probably in 2013 i would say okay i'd say that's about right you know how many plays it was getting around then well it would often it would often cap out so you wouldn't be able to get in unless like you you know remember or whatever and i think the play limit was 15 maybe 20. so that was pretty common that was like every couple of days or maybe<br>
<br>
On the weekends it would cap out this was built you know pre 1.8 venture update 2011 yeah definitely so these players who have set up the shops here they're really active anymore and not so much oh no like you know like there's probably just probably two players that i've seen in the last year that were around at this time and so you're a mod on the server now aren't you yeah yeah so do you actually have many issues with uh trolls griefers or<br>
<br>
Anything they actually have to do much moderating back like uh pre maybe i think it was like 2015 we had like a fair bit of shoes like the server was pretty popular so you'd get a lot of new players but um we lost like all our band records at one point in 2015 and so everyone that was banned got unbanned and we were expecting a huge wave of griefers to come in but um it never happened and we pretty much didn't have any griefs for five years after that<br>
<br>
This would be 2010 easily um this is before me even i think so oh wow yeah that's interesting this is this is really cool actually this is it yeah this is like the this really has that vibe doesn't it so this was a one of novellas former mods i think sort of made this amex a mix a lot so he's not active anymore no we've lost like a lot of a lot of mods over time you know they probably all have kids now like that you know<br>
<br>
10 years ago so so it's kind of scary but is that um obtained legitimately baby what do you like most about the community they're all really like friendly and they're all really like uh supportive and i've never had any like toxicity issues with anybody on this server like there's always like that good vibe going i think they're just a nice group of people really and it's<br>
<br>
Nice seeing old builds and i mean i spend i don't even build that much stuff anymore on the server i spend most of my time just like flying around looking at yeah it's at buildings because there's so many like it's just i find new stuff every day do you recognize any of these creators digital mischief or castle i think digital mischief was a moderator for a while daniel jackson what and albus were like this sort of original three and then i think kazanyo and<br>
<br>
Jacksonville were just like up on our friends or whatever so they sort of stopped playing over the years but they sometimes pop in and like have a look around and compliment people's builds or whatever but yeah they haven't been on for years this is a castle here it has cyan wall um as it's like points so they used to be diamond blocks but someone someone<br>
<br>
Came and stole the wall and replaced them and i think like it went unnoticed for a while but looking at that now it's pretty obvious since you've been playing the server so long would you say that there was a period where you were most active and you just played off and on since then yeah well i i sort of just take breaks for like months sometimes um but you know when i do play which is like you<br>
<br>
Know sort of now just started playing again it's like i'll just play every day for a couple of months or so but it's usually because there's just no people around so a bunch of people will come on and then everyone will start playing again and then people will sort of start to burn out the server's gone in cycles like that for a couple of years now i think yeah no that sounds about right of course it's interesting to see old stuff that<br>
<br>
Has like unique elements to it i guess um this isn't that old really um pretty awesome though uh you know it's in the jungle biome currently the service world border is 20 000 blocks in each direction and the server is on 1.17.1 there are currently 13 spawns and so many warps i can't even count them all oh and if you're curious where the server's name came from it's a reference<br>
<br>
To the heinlein novel the moon is a harsh mistress where novolen is short for a russian city named new leningrad the server has a few plugins such as runecraft which adds magic runes and unique features to the game keeping in theme with the server runecraft is one of the longest running minecraft mods dating back to 2010 with its earliest versions created for minecraft alpha there's also some custom recipes as you can see on the website while the smp is<br>
<br>
The main attraction the server also has a classic style creative plot world which has been running for quite some time as well you can also go to slash warp old creative to really get a blast from the past rob has pasted in one of his older minecraft classic creative worlds which potentially dates back all the way to 2009 which you can fly around and explore but building is mostly limited to the plot world now the community is extremely friendly and<br>
<br>
Welcoming as is common amongst older and more mature minecraft servers joining the server exploring it and talking with the players gave me more of a private smp with friends feel rather than a massive public and a motionless server if you do decide to check the server out please be respectful and friendly with the active players this is not an anarchy server remember so there are rules and cheating is not tolerated i'll leave links to their discord and website<br>
<br>
Down below as well as where you can go to donate thank you to everyone on the server who showed me around and told me about the servers immense history it was one of the most enjoyable experiences i've had since beginning youtube i hope you all enjoyed the video as much as i did making it be sure to subscribe as usual thank you all so much for watching [Music]</p>

<br><br><p class="up">On this channel we're no stranger to old servers from the streams i've tried on escape restart to the mini series on minecraft online which i promise i'll probably update in the future it's been a tradition for over a year now to check in on some of the oldest servers still around to preserve their history to the best of our abilities now throughout my time making videos about the oldest servers i've seen an argument come up<br>
<br>
Again and again most people have narrowed it down to just two being nerd.new and minecraft online nerd.new launched way back in june 2009 but is constantly reset and shut down over the last 12 years minecraft online on the other hand launched about a year later when survival multiplayer was released but has been running the same map non-stop for over a decade players argue back and forth about whether their favorite server truly holds the claim to<br>
<br>
Being the oldest server around but what if i told you there was a third nearly unknown server in the competition a survival server that launched the same day as minecraft online but running a world that started months earlier in this episode of minecraft uncovered we're going to be exploring the story of novilen an ancient forgotten minecraft server that just might be considered the oldest around before we get into anything i have to<br>
<br>
Give a few important shout outs firstly to for unto christ a moderator of minecraft online that let me know about the server several days ago i also want to thank dograph i hope i'm pronouncing that right a moderator of novolen for inviting my friend in the first place and finally i want to thank saplo another smaller youtuber that recently brought some attention to the server and really got the ball rolling honestly prior to saplow's video novolin was<br>
<br>
Virtually unknown for most of the day it was completely empty and the server would peak at a player count of five but today because of his contributions to the community the server is averaging around twice that definitely check him out if you're interested in anything regarding novolin he actually just posted another video interviewing the owner of the server but speaking of novolin what actually is it how did it begin how has it evolved and most<br>
<br>
Importantly how haven't we heard of it well there's certainly a bit of a story let's take a trip down memory lane august 3rd 2010 minecraft 1.0.15 had just released the newest iteration of survival mode build 15 wasn't a huge update to the game mainly just bringing bug fixes crafting changes you know small things but among the small things was this a conspicuous ip address field on the main screen of the game now by this point in the game's<br>
<br>
Development multiplayer wasn't unheard of there had been unofficial creative tests in minecraft classic since may of 2009 and notch had even opened the server for survival testing over the last few weeks but never before did it seem like minecraft was close to officially supporting user run multiplayer the only question now was when there wasn't any sort of server software or tutorial on how to get a server up and running all that we could<br>
<br>
See was a text field that was so far pretty useless but the minecraft community wouldn't have to wait much longer on august 4th of 2010 the one-year anniversary of the first survival test survival multiplayer officially released to the public and hundreds of players rushed to set up their very own server to share with friends or even open to the public among these were some of the biggest names in the history of minecraft multiplayer<br>
<br>
Names like minecraft online which is generally considered the oldest minecraft server and crazy fool's uk a lesser known server that had risen to the top back in the day but they weren't the only ones in fact even on the crazy fools uk website you can catch a glimpse of the minecraft multiplayer scene on day one servers like aunt jemima's home style survival and s p just for screwing around a partial anarchy server called nefanya and so on today these servers<br>
<br>
Have long since been forgotten shutting down over a decade ago in most cases but among these empty husks was a familiar name novolin launched at day one of the multiplayer release novalin grew quickly as one of the smoothest servers online at the time and started getting tons of new players from server lists forum posts and friends sharing it with each other but for a while nothing really set novalin apart that was until august 28th with the release of runecraft the<br>
<br>
Longest running minecraft plugin which is still being updated to this day runecraft adds runic magic to the game allowing players to teleport across the map lift massive islands out of the ocean clone their creations build nearly invincible sets of gear and much much more back in 2010 the technology was pretty primitive as you can imagine but you have to understand that the expectations were low nothing like this had ever been done before<br>
<br>
In 2010 your idea of a plugin would be a few new commands for banning players or setting homes you could respawn at not summoning an acid storm over your worst enemies a project like runecraft was practically unheard of and it turned novolin from a basic survival into an active war zone it was chaos with players running around at mach speed in the hopes of finding weak new players to savagely murder and pathetic dirt huts they could destroy but while i guarantee<br>
<br>
It was pretty crazy in these early days today that history has disappeared aside from a few posts on the recently resurrected forum the disorder of early novolin has been lost to time and after a few months after newer servers and wilder game modes began to release novolin's player count slowly dropped lower and lower was this going to be the end well of course not i mean come on i'm playing on the server right now it can't<br>
<br>
Be minecraft's oda server if it doesn't exist anymore but how did it survive well to be honest luck novolin had the perfect combination of luck and nostalgia to keep a small loyal player base over the years and when i say small i mean small one or two players on at a time but it was enough to keep this piece of minecraft history alive throughout the years and even today as we enter 2022 there are still players around from the start of the<br>
<br>
Novolin timeline players like dograph and doozy have stuck around for the last decade several of them even becoming moderators of the server and aside from the owner's good intentions they're really all that's kept novolin alive to this day from 2011 through november of 2021 that's all they've had just a small group of maybe a hundred or so players that would actively play the server plus the rare visitor from some old minecraft forum post a youtube video from 2011 or<br>
<br>
Something else of the sort but come late november of this year that would all start to change and this this is where saplo makes an appearance like myself saplow was no stranger to documenting minecraft history interviewing players of sim pvp anarchy making his own alpha server and even uploading a few minecraft online videos over the years something was different this time around though something was special this wasn't just<br>
<br>
Some random server with a reputation for being old this was a well-kept secret he had hidden away for over a year and on november 27th he revealed it in his first video since july minecraft's oldest unknown server now saplo is a smaller youtuber but this video did honestly pretty well he got 500 views in under a week numbers i could have only dreamed of having when my channel was the size of his but more importantly a few important<br>
<br>
Figures took notice and began to spread the word moderators of minecraft online popular 2b2t youtubers like dig mc and fast vincent and even just regulars of the minecraft history community began to share it with friends post about it on their discords and invite anyone they could to populate this once wasteland of a server and it worked right now the server's healthier than it's been in years and we just might be able to bring the story of novolin to the masses so<br>
<br>
Here i am doing my part 11 years after the launch of the server to give the minecraft community a glimpse into the mystery that is novolin thanks for watching the video and i really hope you all enjoyed i've been wanting to make another old server video for quite a while now so i was super happy to get the news from foreign to christ shout out to you of course and dograph since you're basically the reason that i'm here and of course shout<br>
<br>
Out to saplo as well since he's the reason everybody else is here i'll leave a link to his channel in the description he has two videos on the server already and another one is premiering soon but that's about all i've got to say so yeah thanks again and have a good one guys peace [Music] you<p>

<br>
Already checked it and found everything there was to be found or found nothing after a mild amount of deliberation i decided to go for it i decided to give looking for an unreset 2010 server a shot it's lucky that i did because i just so happened to find this this server the one that i'm making this video about minecraft.novalin.net here's the website on the server website there's a live map<br>
<br>
Viewer what i saw there made the entire search worth it it was a massive expanse of generated terrain filled with abandoned builds the middle of the server consists of nothing but alpha generated terrain i did what i thought was impossible i found a perfectly preserved still active survival server from 2010 in an hour no map resets and a very small but dedicated community of players the map was actually the single player<br>
<br>
World used by the owner so the map actually has older generated chunks than the version of the server was started on as of writing this their discord contains 75 people my own discord has more than that i am not a popular youtuber by any means but my entire community of people is more than who play this server after asking the owner some questions i was told that the server was created august 4th 2010 the day minecraft multiplayer<br>
<br>
Was released this just so happens to be the exact day another server by the name of minecraft online was created another unreset survival server the main difference between the two servers is its popularity novlin has 10 active players a week at best minecraft online has multiple million view videos made on it and it averages 20 players daily i was incredibly lucky in finding novolim when so many people haven't<br>
<br>
The owner has informed me that only a few thousand people have joined over the past 11 years the community that does play has been very busy building the map is riddled with interesting complex and high effort builds one of the best things to come from the lack of player activity is how spacious the world is you can literally hop onto the server walk over to the alpha and beta chunks and build your base there<br>
<br>
Without feeling like you're invading someone else's space something you can't do in minecraft online so anywhere on minecraft online pretty much server performance is amazing especially given that the server runs the most current version of the game as of writing this 1.17.1 the world is split into separate spawns which are all accessible through a portal plug-in system current spawn is nowhere near the beta<br>
<br>
And alpha chunks the server also offers a creative mode world which has been reset in the past novlen is one of minecraft's oldest servers ranking in top five at least according to my calculations and i happen to be slightly more educated in this topic than uh the people who write those website blogs so don't trust them they don't know anything and is a long-lost sister<br>
<br>
Server of sorts to minecraft online it is absolutely amazing the server exists and that it has gone completely under the radar with this video i hope to have fixed that a link to novolin's discord server and website are located in the description if you liked what you watched here maybe consider subscribing i am wearing my celebratory suit t-shirt and i brought out the simpson slippers<br>
<br>
If you can you can see them here simpson slipper number one slipper number two it's pretty epic i don't wear them every time i record a video only this time [Music] you</p></div>
