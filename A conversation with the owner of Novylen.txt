in today's video i have gotten the immense privilege of being able to interview
0:06
our boss the owner and creator and maintainer of novolin.net
0:13
minecraft.novalin.net the oldest long-running server map in all of minecraft uh and that's what
0:19
novaland.net is for those of you who don't know and we will be discussing plenty of things in this really long
0:26
video and to make things easier for you when watching especially if you don't want to watch the entire thing i have
0:32
bookmarked all the questions that are asked in this video in the description and you can just kind of click the time
0:38
stamps in the description and you will get to the question if you want to just know the answer to a specific one enjoy
0:45
hello uh our boss uh can you uh explain to everyone a little bit about
0:51
who you are um well i'm a dude who runs a minecraft server
0:57
among other things i'm 40-ish i've been running minecraft
1:04
servers on and off for like 15 years no no i don't know if it goes that far
1:10
back but i used to run the old classic creative servers for funsies
1:15
and uh transitioned into multiplayer a while back too
1:21
um i do i t for pers for
1:28
[Music]
1:34
i have a cat he's black he's very fat all same same
1:40
yeah okay that's uh that's a pretty good introduction for you there um
1:46
yeah it's just uh it's very exciting it's very exciting to be doing this right now um
1:52
yeah so you've been you've been running this server um for uh over 10 years now is that that's
1:58
correct yeah that is the case it's it's been a long road
2:04
yeah that's that is just absolutely nuts all right so we're gonna do this
2:09
interview i will start with the first questions uh like the first official ones why did you start the server
2:16
um well i enjoyed playing minecraft you know at the time
2:22
it was it was minecraft has always been a unique experience from the beginning it was kind of the first of its genre a
2:28
really genre defining kind of game and
2:34
it was fun to play and as someone who's technologically inclined and who's always kind of
2:40
looking for opportunities to sharpen my tech technical skills um it's kind of offered an opportunity
2:47
to encounter challenges in server
2:54
challenges in it maintenance that you wouldn't really run into otherwise
3:00
it kind of motive it kind of creates i like to create myself problems sometimes
3:05
so that you can figure out ways to solve them and it's a good way to kind of keep your
3:10
keep your hat in the ring if your ordinary job doesn't really create opportunities to learn new skills and
3:18
creating a minecraft server has given me the opportunity to learn about
3:23
server virtualization about maintenance backups
3:30
various technologies regarding containerization and you know how to run a website how to run
3:35
a wiki um and there's also a lot of other fun little site projects involving like how
3:42
to run an economy how does an economy work how does money work how does inflation work um
3:49
how do you how do you create and maintain a player base that is
3:54
you know with as few unsavory elements as possible you know how do you get the
4:00
nice people to float to the top and the crappy people look to the floor to the book to sink to the bottom
4:05
and that's there's all sorts of little fun um projects that are kind of subsumed
4:11
within the entire minecraft umbrella you know yeah
4:19
um all right uh where where does the server name come from on like the similar note
4:26
not many people ask about this it's from a robert a heinlein book the moon is a harsh mistress
4:32
uh naviland is the name of the russian city on the moon new leningrad navi
4:37
leningrad and it's uh just a silly literary
4:42
reference and one of my favorite books heinlein is uh is is one of my favorite authors
4:49
and uh the moon is irish mistress is a is a good book to come back to from time to time
4:55
uh it's it's kind of a libertarian sort of utopian novel which has its own
5:01
problems and but uh it's a fun read i'll definitely uh maybe check it out
5:07
after this yeah it's pretty short a couple hundred pages uh it doesn't
5:13
oh sorry i can continue oh it's a good adventure story about like a revolution on the moon
5:20
all right yeah that's cool is it like kind of like uh like a like a com like a commentary on like socialism or
5:26
something like that or comedy yeah yeah it kind of mirrors the american revolution it's heinlein's
5:32
idea of what an ideal ideal libertarian society would look like and how it might develop it uh
5:40
and it has a lot of allusions to uh different like the spanish revolution so the spanish civil war for instance and
5:46
the american revolution and uh bits and pieces of the soviet um
5:53
the soviet revolution and how that came to pass and you can dig into it this there's some
5:59
literary uh meat on that bone okay that sounds very interesting
6:06
yeah so go hopping off from uh like the the server name what about like the world itself does it have like a
6:12
special name that you've got for it oh no none at all no it is the server it
6:18
is the map the world map okay yeah fair enough it's just like
6:23
continue in my scripts it's just called smp i see i see
6:29
yeah just because like uh minecraft online which is the other server um that's like similar to this uh they they
6:35
called their their world freedomia but they're mine the server is called minecraft online so i was just yeah
6:41
um what keeps you motivated to keep the server running
6:47
uh guilt um because so many people have put so much work into it at this point that i
6:54
can spare a few minutes to keep it going um and it you know it helps keep the skills sharpened a little bit yeah like
7:01
i said it gives me a reason to do things and there's a there's such a good group of people that um i i'd hate to disappoint
7:08
them um as soon as occasionally i just think of i feel like i want to just let go of the
7:15
whole project and kind of let it languish or publish the map online as a torrent
7:21
somewhere and just let people deal with it but then somebody asks me
7:26
hey have you checked out this build or do you want to install this plug-in for
7:32
me and i'll be like oh fine so in that case the player base are kind
7:37
of like my pets it's like a giant tamagotchi
7:44
that's kind of like a fun way of looking at it uh yeah the players are gonna love me talking them talking about them like
7:50
that i'm sure uh yeah cause they're kind of in the same van have you like considered like
7:55
i'm guessing you've considered shutting the server down a lot like like is that something you think about a lot or
8:01
oh from time to time like sometimes things get super broken or another plug-in breaks for the
8:07
thousandth time and yeah then i'm just like you know what i i've
8:13
threatened to shut it down a few times but it's just never gotten to that point yeah but like uh
8:20
in all of the times you've really considered it when was like the like closest you came to actually like
8:25
shutting the server down um probably a few years ago when i kind
8:30
of went through a sort of depressive phase and just couldn't find the spoons to do anything at all
8:37
and i ended up just leaving it on version 1.13 for a while because
8:43
i didn't really like i didn't really have the money to upgrade the hardware and i didn't really have the
8:48
interest in the optimizing out the performance issues
8:57
and i just did couldn't really be bothered to care about it for quite a while so mostly i just kind of
9:03
let it stay at a pretty static level for a while and neglect tried to neglect it to death
9:09
you know like sometimes you just don't have the courage to kill something outright and
9:14
you just kind of forget about it for a while and just don't think about it until it kind of goes away on its own
9:21
for a while i kind of tried to do that but it it didn't quite succeed
9:26
yeah and then my my work actually offers me some
9:31
money every few years to um invest in personal development and every
9:39
end every couple of cycles of that i can buy new servers with it so i that money came in and then i had
9:46
then i finally kind of rekindled in interest in rebuilding computer servers in general and uh
9:54
and uh having a fresh shiny new piece of computer hardware means that you're not
10:00
i'm no longer struggling with performance issues or
10:05
hardware limitations and i can just kind of just do things instead of having to struggle with the 15 frames per
10:13
second or 10 frames per second or whatever and people complaining about like which is kind of nice
10:19
oh yeah that's that sounds like that sounds like that's really nice especially like uh your work giving you funds to do that on the side a little
10:26
bit it is yeah yeah yeah if i may ask where where do you work
10:33
um at a university in southwest canada oh that's really cool
10:39
uh do you enjoy like running the server and like interacting with the community
10:46
most of the time most of the time it's a great group of people i absolutely love the people that sign into the server and
10:52
have stuck with it through the years and uh they've made such amazingly beautiful projects that i
11:00
i can't find it in me to um
11:06
to take that away from them i see i see uh it's like i get a little secondary
11:12
pride from other people's work it's like a little end yeah as someone who who runs the
11:18
minecraft servers as well like i totally get what you're talking about um
11:25
uh so like i'm i'm guessing just since you've been running the server for so long have you made like any friends like
11:30
through the server oh yeah yeah
11:36
a lot of people on the server i would i would consider friends very few of them have i met in person uh
11:43
one of the moderators was my was an uh a friend that
11:49
met that we met sorry we met on warcraft world of warcraft a couple of years
11:54
before we start the server and we played together there and transitioned
11:59
into minecraft and um yeah they're still online from time to time doozy you've probably seen her
12:06
oh yeah cool yeah and we've known each other for a long time and yeah very few in you know meat-space
12:14
friendships because you know scattered across the continent [Music]
12:22
okay um i consider most regulars friends
12:27
okay cool uh how many players uh do you like all
12:33
total do you keep in touch with like out of the people who have joined so far
12:38
outside of minecraft i don't think many one or two really oh yeah i i actually
12:46
uh miss phrase that question like uh other like early players who joined like the first to like year the server was
12:51
opened or like the first couple years like how many of them do you keep in touch with is or is that most of the community
12:57
huh i would say there's at least a few
13:05
yeah you know people people come and people go um people drift on and go move on with
13:12
their lives get married i mean server's about that old yeah
13:18
yeah and then in one memorable instance there's one kid who started like age 13
13:24
who has since gotten married and had children and he pops back from time to time and says hi which is which is great i love
13:31
it when people say hi i mean it brings a little light to to a day
13:39
that's a very crazy a giant nostalgia machine i i swear every time i come in i
13:44
just find something that goes that makes me go oh my god remember that
13:51
um yeah what's uh speaking of like finding things on the server what's your uh
13:56
favorite old build or a build in general like on the server um
14:03
there's something by that i've made or somebody else just in general like your favorite thing on the server
14:09
oh we can actually go visit it um if you if you want to
14:14
i was thinking the cathedral build uh assuming i can find it
14:22
it's your second spawn which and yeah this is one of the earliest
14:27
complex built server made by a guy named rainy d2 and
14:33
i think by modern standards you you you would consider this not super impressive
14:38
but you have to remember the guy built it in survival and he built it with you know these big complex builds weren't
14:44
really a thing what year was this oh it had to have been 20
14:50
10 late 2010 mid 2010. like it was really crazy 2010
14:56
this was made yeah this is right by second spawn which should give you some idea of how
15:02
and i probably started the second spawn like a couple of months after i started the server
15:08
you know the first one starts to get a little crowded if you if you look over there you see the tower that's second spot
15:15
wow that's awesome yeah and there's a little chick in there hill
15:20
a little chicken hey just put an egg out oh
15:28
um all right uh so um i just like a question about like
15:35
the old older older times how like how active was the server in like the old versions
15:42
like or at least like within like like the first year or two like how how many players did you have oh we'd frequently hit 10 to 15. i mean
15:51
we would cap out i don't i don't think i've ever really put the server over 15 users simultaneously
15:58
but wait we frequently cap out that okay uh and like it's like
16:03
pretty quick too like lots of different sign uh different and uh just not stay
16:08
for very long but uh kind of a core develops gotcha gotcha like uh yeah so how long
16:15
was did that like uh like player like activity level stay at for like how many years was that
16:22
five or six years i mean we had a pretty steady community for quite a
16:27
while um minecraft i think minecraft in general stopped being
16:32
as popular at least minecraft vanilla stopped being a spot because players today have kind of higher expectations
16:38
minecraft server than just straight up because if you want to play a vanilla
16:44
minecraft server friend just spin up your own
16:50
um and uh all the big professional minecraft mini games and such
16:56
yeah but i've always kind of preferred the uh plane survival experience
17:04
yeah so like uh why why is there is so little advertising done for the server it seems it's like
17:11
this is incredibly hard like to find like all relatively speaking
17:16
i mean i used to i used to advertise i went on the minecraft server.net and put
17:22
up a post i think i've made a reddit post or two
17:28
advertising is hard it's fair you know are am i what like am i trying to make a
17:35
profit i if you're not trying to actually make money from from it if you're not trying to grow it and
17:41
kind of extract it extract rent from it then what's the point of adwords if you have your group of people like
17:48
and uh have your core of regulars that pop by stuff
17:54
almost advertising is almost asking for trouble because you're just gonna get a
18:00
stream of new users and new users are a lot of work i mean you gotta vet them watch them
18:07
filter them out yes yeah that you know that's it's very understandable like i honestly i think
18:13
it might be easier to find this server like uh if you don't know the name of it um if you go through the wayback machine
18:20
like i did and look at the old surfer list archives from 2010
18:27
that's fine there's just less servers it's um
18:32
yeah so have like uh you were talking a little bit earlier about um like others minecraft servers like around like like
18:39
2015-14 and being mostly mini game focused and stuff like have you ever considered like adding in kind of game
18:45
modes like that to this server or was that never really a thing you thought wanted to do or thought about
18:50
oh yeah we had a mini game side world for quite a while um there was a yeah i played around with a
18:56
bunch of different plugins i tried to get someone else to maintain it for a while and we went through a couple
19:02
of minutes uh there's the steward rank which um person responsible for a particular
19:09
world or a particular map um i did a skype lock world for a while that was fun a lot of people enjoyed
19:15
that in fact i've still got it kicking around it would be too hard to spin it up again oh okay like yeah so how many
19:22
of those like mini game things do you still have like set up
19:27
none of them are left since i kept them all on my site uh sites we use the bungie multi server
19:33
architecture so you can spin up in servers and destroy them as you need which is pretty
19:40
handy so like uh like the only one that's left is the sky
19:46
block is it just the splat skyblock uh map not the play no not the map the plugin and not the map that kind of deal
19:52
oh no i don't have that anymore it was on a separate server it's gone i mean i still have the files
19:59
and the map still exists it's just not you know running i see i see okay
20:04
um that's interesting that's cool to know i got something i didn't know before uh i'm glad i asked the question
20:11
something you could bring back pretty easily yeah um i mean there's definitely room for
20:16
that i'm sure there now especially now there's probably going to be an audience for something like that potentially but the question is how much
20:23
effort do you want to put yeah exactly i mean i'm only one guy and i don't
20:29
really need to uh write her to like i don't really want to be a manager and
20:35
if you have a team of moderators or administrators uh maintaining individual servers then
20:40
you become a manager it's like who has time
20:46
that's kind of like the same deal that the the owner of minecraft online is doing um he kind of just stepped away
20:52
from like actually running the server and he's got like a giant team of moderators who just does everything for
20:57
him but like they never really talk to him much he's just kind of like away from the project now but he keeps it up because you know it's old so
21:04
yeah kind of like kind of like like to say probably for similar reasons why you do just like don't does don't have the heart to to put it down you know
21:12
yeah um but he's figured out a way to like keep it like self-sustaining he doesn't have to get involved
21:19
that's cool getting to that point would be pretty interesting yeah um
21:24
well that's definitely something to be considered uh uh let's see the next question is uh
21:31
like what was minecraft like in general like uh back when you first started the server like what was what was the like
21:37
mechanically and like community wise socially and like the environment back then was was like the vibe what was that
21:44
what was that like
21:52
simpler i would say i mean minecraft it's kind of gone the lego route you know how lego like
21:59
you have these lego sets that are basically just a whole bunch of four by two blocks and you can build whatever
22:05
you want out of those bit of those basic few blocks and then you get into the lego sets that have all these special purpose pieces
22:12
i think minecraft's kind of gone a little bloaty in that direction that too many special purpose and
22:18
too much variety of building blocks now you know i actually completely agree with that
22:24
that doesn't say too much about the culture though but um it's it's more it's more game focused now
22:32
like people expect more of game from minecraft like minecraft isn't really a game by
22:38
itself anymore it's more more platform upon which you build games
22:43
is this like skylocks well yeah we're similar to that what are your
22:48
thoughts on similar servers to what you like in age to what you're currently running like minecraft online or two
22:54
builders to tools i mean it sounds like a lot of people are having a lot of fun and more power
23:00
to them i mean wow so much so much amazing gameplay happening there
23:06
like i personally cannot stand pvp and anarchy servers
23:11
but i'm really glad that some people are enjoying it and staying away from our
23:16
server yeah minecraft online is not
23:23
yeah um you know fair enough fair enough there they keep they keep the they attract all
23:29
the all the nasty ones yeah there's some kind of unsavory
23:35
elements out there you know the edge lords and yeah oh great nazis and whatnot
23:42
which are kind of hard to to distinguish from each other sometimes yeah a little bit a little bit
23:47
can you like describe a little bit of uh what the early days of the server were like
23:53
oh chaotic lots and lots of griefers so many griefers like right off the bat when the fir when
24:00
the first smp patch dropped there was no server-side inventory it was all client-side oh yeah
24:07
literally anybody could spawn literally any item with uh pretty trivial um it wasn't even
24:13
hacking at that point it was just that how the game worked right so anything you built would get covered in
24:20
lava instantly there were no there were no there were no protections um
24:25
in fact i i knew this was going to be a thing so my the very first service fund
24:31
was not what the cur what the what it what first spawn is i call it like zero spawn so there's just like this little area
24:38
near out out at like minus two thousand comma zero that it's the actual first spawn
24:45
point of the server and it got pretty nutty because people just
24:52
yeah it looked like you you see the 2b 2b gt spawn area it got a bit like that
24:59
can we actually like can we check that out right now or is that oh probably um
25:05
let me see if i can figure out where it is exactly yeah that's kind of it's funny to think that
25:10
that's the uh like the uh true the true first spawn point yeah
25:16
i uh i filmed this oh you found it all right awesome um
25:23
i'm just going to drop to the floor all right yeah don't want to teleport me well i'm incredible
25:32
okay i even have a little spawn region here protecting our little world guard region here protecting it
25:40
and as silly as it seems this little wall thing might actually be the oldest
25:46
multiplayer structure on the server really oh wow that's crazy
25:52
i mean i've restored it and yeah like it used to be bombed out so i've i just
25:57
ended up restoring it from back up oh wow there's this giant castle oh that castle i saw it on the on the world
26:03
right now yeah yeah that's sixth spawn a lot of it was edited in but um
26:09
oh dang it stupid cat is he on your desk
26:15
yeah i'm covered in orange juice now give me a sec cat would like some attention please
26:22
but yeah there's a lot of lands landmarks that are kind of like uh unimpressive in in an absolute sense but
26:31
of note only because they're like the oldest x or uh
26:36
it's like oh look at this little box structure it's just impressive that it's still
26:42
there after all these years though so yeah i slept on a protection region on top of it
26:50
um yeah good times do you have any uh like uh uh fond
26:56
memories from those times like honestly one of my fonder memories is
27:02
cleaning up griefing because i enjoy cleaning up other people's messes is
27:07
kind of it's kind of fun i mean you grumble about it but uh restoring an
27:12
ugly landscape into something that looks passable this is pretty pretty interesting
27:18
okay um yeah i can kind of relate i did i've done similar things on my server
27:24
and some people make some absolutely epic messes oh yeah now now that you have trivial roll black
27:30
roll backs with core protect and whatnot and log block i mean it kind of takes some of the fun out of restoration work
27:38
oh i was um because you see that little road to the south there a bit one of my early projects was to kind of
27:44
just pick a direction and go and just build a road out and this was kind of like as
27:50
far as i had gone on my personal nap in this direction so i was like you know what this can be the spawn point right
27:55
here and this this is just far enough away from all my stuff
28:01
that i'm not too worried about again i see i see yeah
28:06
um oh yeah you ported the map over from or like you just moved the map over from imp dev to
28:12
to the newest version of uh alpha right yeah yeah it was my multiplayer alpha
28:18
and i didn't want to rebuild everything so i was just like you know what scp there we go
28:25
well that might that makes this probably the oldest uh still running minecraft map
28:31
um yeah i guess you could say that but i mean i'm sure other people have done
28:38
the same thing well sure but they didn't do probably didn't start it on the same version and
28:44
go for it like i'm i'm talking like just still going like you're competing with like two other surfers here
28:49
it's true it's true yeah so if you if you could like date the
28:54
zero comma zero map it might go a few months before snp i don't remember exactly
29:00
yeah if it went if it has inft uh generation which it does right then it's
29:06
it's got a it's got an older map than minecraft online which is the only other server
29:12
that started the same day as you and kept their map the entire time but they started their server like
29:18
this the map is the same day as the as the server to my knowledge so i think
29:24
you get you get the crowning achievement for that one yeah yeah there was a little excitement about
29:30
the smp release back in the day so a lot of people started up servers back then
29:36
i'm really surprised not so many people have been well i'm sure a lot of people are still running servers they're just
29:42
not running the same maps yeah there are i spent many hours searching through old
29:48
uh old addresses when i was on the way back machine i found probably 50
29:54
uh and most of them are just like they reset every year or they're private servers but they're they're there
29:59
they're still there there's still communities around from that time yeah it it takes a certain amount of
30:04
bloody minded determination to stay with the same map because oh yeah create so
30:10
many problems for yourself like old duped items stay around old builds
30:16
like old farms for instance just because people run into old melon farms or whatever and hey then you've got free
30:23
food for life it creates gameplay issues because people get can get a whole bunch of free
30:28
stuff by old builds i mean all those xp farms out in the world so you can just wander up to them
30:35
and hey free infinite xp and resetting the map kind of solves that problem
30:40
oh yeah i've got a lot of friends of mine who are like just reset it it'll uh set a map or something like that that's
30:45
how like you bring fresh life into it everyone gets to the same level playing field right and the progression is back
30:51
but it's like you lose something else with that in my opinion at least yeah like i can't bring myself to delete
30:58
all bills there's just such a staggering amount of creativity in them oh yeah and it's like knifing your own child you
31:05
know the partner metaphor i don't know it's it's appropriate it's appropriate
31:14
i mean you don't want to kick a puppy exactly yeah um
31:19
yeah so for like hosting the server how do you how do you how did you and like how are you currently hosting the server
31:27
well i and a friend of mine run a kind of mutual little server remote
31:34
at his house um and we kind of do it semi-professionally like we we try to
31:39
like just to keep our skills up we kind of run it as a semi-professional affair so we um use it to keep up to date with
31:46
certain technologies um so we try to have proper backups set up and we
31:52
try to have a good virtualization um we try to have a good a good
31:58
good i.t standard practices you know and uh it keeps us in the game
32:04
well that's awesome seems like the server couldn't be in any better hands yeah yeah
32:10
i mean it's not something we really run a profit on but we're not trying to the profit is in skill development
32:17
yeah um what was the world like in inf dev before you had it as a server
32:25
um overwhelming because before inft diff you just had these little 256 by 256
32:32
square maps and they were cozy and interesting like uh
32:38
you used to have just this like this one little island in the middle of the map and it felt very lonely and
32:45
and that that's great like you're a sole survivor and at the time that was very unique
32:50
experience um a lot a lot of fun but then you go from
32:56
that into the full kind of minecraft survival experience and you look in any
33:02
direction and i don't think players these days get just how crazy it is that you look in a direction and it just
33:08
keeps going forever like you can you can walk in that direction and you will eventually
33:15
never hit the end i'm not withstanding people like kurt james and his farlands or bust series
33:24
that guy that guy's crazy he's still not there it's been a long
33:29
time yeah yeah i think he's like 30 of the way oh wow yeah he's doing the
33:35
overworld trip which is a lot yeah and he hasn't like a world edited
33:41
himself a straight path or anything there's that one guy who um
33:46
built himself a highway to the end or the our lands and just held down the w key until he got there
33:54
but uh that sounds that feels like cheating yeah it does yeah but kurt jmx kind of
34:00
created treated it like a blog or slash button yeah and i i really enjoy it he's he's a
34:07
he's a comfortable uh speaker and presenter and yeah so like i'm saying i'm guessing
34:13
you were around when he's for his first uh you were watching his first like videos when they first came out the
34:18
first few videos here i mean maybe i came in around episode 10 or 12. i i remember him publishing him
34:25
at the time and being like oh my god is he really going to do that and then i watched him and you know what
34:31
he's he's he's he's a fun guy i like him bouncing off that uh youtubers thing uh
34:38
how like for uh like do you watch any like youtube any minecraft youtubers at
34:43
least as of recent or just in general like do you watch any currently just coaching that cause the
34:49
only one i've really stuck with and mostly because you know it's a nice
34:54
low effort podcast to pay attention to
34:59
sometimes people will link minecraft videos from the server and
35:04
i'll watch those but i know i find a lot of minecraft youtubers kind of too
35:12
oriented like they're really fast-paced screaming at you actually no
35:17
there's that irish guy he he recently did a series about doing minecraft in
35:22
like one chunk oh and that was fun i'll look him up after
35:28
this and uh yeah i'll have reference footage on the screen
35:39
yeah yeah i would recommend him he's very entertaining he's got this amazing irish accent
35:45
it's the most entertaining part of his videos and
35:50
some some people will um do their minecraft videos i'll just completely freak out about every
35:56
these amazingly he's amazingly over-the-top emotional reactions and it comes off as really instancy but
36:02
uh i really enjoy his book that's awesome it's it's not a common person who can
36:08
freak out at everything and actually sell it don't call me that's the that's
36:13
the youtuber calling me kevin all right
36:19
um who were the first players on the server um well actually that's i
36:26
uh i can name a few there's rainy 92 he was among those
36:32
um a couple of the first players actually became my co-admins for a while uh zanio and jack so what
36:39
we're like one of the day one people who joined and i'm like hey you want to be and then they're like oh fine
36:45
and they hung around we became pretty close friends for yeah
36:50
they've since kind of drifted away haven't
36:56
yeah if they came back i think we'd click again pretty quick well who knows maybe they will uh who knows who knows
37:02
um yeah are there like any players this is kind of an overlap question with the last one but are there any players that
37:09
have like stood out uh like uh because of like something noteworthy they've done in the surfer or anything like that
37:14
in your mind you know i have kind of a bad memory for
37:20
that kind of thing so recent players who've done some pretty amazing things uh
37:26
mawadi who has an amazingly huge build of a detailed um
37:32
called la cirque on earth can quickly work to that try to give us a page of
37:37
scenery oh yeah we were here yesterday with yeah
37:42
we were here yesterday and this is kind of one of my favorite places uh it's just
37:48
there's it's just one of those places that where you look at it and there's just such such such loving detail in every or
37:56
such loving work in every detail um but they put quite a lot of effort into it
38:01
when um 1.7 came out they uh
38:06
uh created a whole bunch of they just spent a week re redecorating i thought it was kind of
38:12
great it looks it looks beautiful yeah i love the end rods on the top there and like
38:18
all the all the different plants and stuff yeah yeah she's yeah they've got a good eye
38:26
yeah i i there there's just a ton of them there's uh
38:32
serenada who has who made that that you can see from the server you know space
38:38
the oh made the what i i'm sorry you kind of iron side slash that's a kind of a large city middle of
38:45
the map they've put a lot of work into um
38:52
so in terms of people who've really stood out in a build uh those really
38:58
hit the top of the list for me there's also jamie who's a recent build on this massive underground
39:05
that i still haven't explored oh okay
39:10
yeah what was the longest uh the server's longest uh downtime period
39:17
if there wasn't i would say not more than a week
39:24
like there was one time when we had a pretty bad disc failure
39:30
and i had to pull pretty much everything i had to rebuild pretty much every scratch
39:37
like um restore the vms from backups oh when was that i would say a week is
39:43
about the longest time uh when was the when was the failure
39:51
oh 2016. actually i can tell you it's like april 4th 2016 because all of the
39:56
time stamps and my files are that because when i restored it i lost all
40:01
the timestamps for a bunch of things so how much was lost
40:07
um nothing in the minecraft server but on my personal like utility server which
40:13
hosts uh dns and email and such um i lost a couple of user accounts
40:19
because yeah yeah my personal maybe
40:27
um because well the backup i only managed to restore like the top 80 of you accounts
40:35
so like a through q were restored but everything past that wasn't so my own account was fine but
40:43
anyone who anyone whose username started the queue or higher was screwed so that was pretty good
40:49
um oh that's upset that's probably annoying it was super annoying i had to leave
40:54
some very nice apology notes um
41:00
what part of running novolin is the most difficult
41:07
i i was gonna say recruiting good people but honestly good people are
41:13
pretty easy to find like i i
41:18
i find that most players have
41:23
have a really great attitude even the ones that seem like they just
41:30
oh sorry you cut out there oh sorry i turned away
41:38
the most difficult part of running
41:44
i think just finding the personal uh motivation to do things has always
41:50
been a challenge for me like um you know you have to do something it's
41:56
easy to do it you just have to actually and yeah i i really struggle with that
42:04
i'm pretty fundamentally lazy well i i can kind of relate to that
42:09
this is part of a reason i found your server and like a year later i made a video on it
42:15
yeah i remember we talked about a free fleet accident and that was when you still had the portal of this the split gate plug-in
42:22
oh the wormholes yeah that's the gate i really missed those
42:29
well you know what maybe we can get somebody to like update the plugin fingers crossed a few people have taken
42:36
um well i think if any any of the any of the videos that come out on the server
42:42
actually go off pop off you'll probably find someone able to do it and willing to do it
42:47
potentially it's an amazing plugin it's a point-to-point teleportation
42:53
system with kind of a neat little bush animation when you activate a start and it's lucky enough to use a few
43:00
it's just thematically fun and i i've always had it i've always had a problem with command based mechanics
43:07
like i i absolutely hate warp commands they're silly they're they're not
43:13
they're not gameplay motivated they're just magic incantations
43:19
uh i i really like things like runecraft for instance that have an in-game component
43:26
that has an in-game effect you're not just typing in word in
43:32
the slash command and the the stargate of wormhole extreme
43:38
the name of the plugin i've kind of had exactly what i wanted in a teleport plugin
43:46
i see well um yeah i uh i will try and see if i can
43:52
find someone to help with the plug-in thing later um yeah
43:58
it's a bit of a challenge because the database is stored as kind of a binary blob instead of any kind of standard
44:05
sql format uh so importing the data is right off the bat we had to jump through
44:11
some hoops to get the get out and uh
44:16
the um author of the plugin itself has been struggling with uh
44:23
something about the magic number is my services and
44:29
uh porting the data forward has been a challenge i see yeah it's
44:35
i don't i don't wanna i don't wanna size it's fair enough fair enough
44:41
he's a nice guy you don't wanna put too much pressure on oh of course of course not uh
44:47
yeah okay um yeah this is kind of a bit of a of a bit of a sharp turn but um
44:54
like what is like uh would you ever consider selling the server to someone
45:02
um
45:09
i i would consider giving it away to somebody who would
45:15
prop who would maintain it and take care of it it's like would you sell your cat to
45:22
somebody yeah you know like uh i i i i would like to see it taken care
45:28
of hypothetically like if hypothetically i got totally sick and i couldn't couldn't bear to look at it anymore i'd
45:35
at least want somebody to properly take care of it and i hate to use words like vision but
45:40
execute my vision of what it should be like i've always wanted a server that i would want to play on you know yeah and
45:49
yeah and not like not pay to win for instance i i have a pretty strong opinion on that
45:56
um i've always been against people paying for gameplay advantages
46:01
so um like i do have a donation based membership system but
46:08
that will never give you any kind of free loot or
46:16
it'll give you a privilege like you can sign in ahead of other people or you get a special hat
46:23
sign sign in where oh sorry i mean like oh just hypothetically hypothetically we were
46:30
talking about what happens if we suddenly get like a hundred players wanting to come once what happens to
46:36
people who've donated and i was saying you know what you can just bump ahead of the queue of anyone else who isn't a
46:42
paid member all right and that would be my idea of a good yeah
46:47
that sounds fair i think that sounds like far superior to
46:52
like what a server like 2b2t has set up currently oh what do they have set up yeah they
46:58
have a queue system um due to the number of people who want to play it's like it's like like four plus hours long and
47:05
then you can pay for a monthly subscription of 20 bucks to go into a shorter queue that's about like
47:11
occasionally up to an hour long which and it's just like it's not like instant access to the server either it's
47:18
like delayed shorter cue skip kind of and yeah it's not like you can't do any
47:25
one-time payments for that kind of deal right it sounds like they're a victim of their own success oh yeah oh yeah but
47:31
they're also they're partly where they're like they kind of need the money from the serve from that queue so they
47:36
they're not incentivized to remove it uh or make it like more fair and like easier for people to get in and out
47:43
um yeah so they don't keep it the same it sounds like an unpleasant experience
47:48
of a player oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
47:54
yeah there's a lot of complaints with that server that's part of why a lot of people quit playing it
48:01
that in the community but then that's two different two different uh problems
48:07
uh yes we kind of really discussed this we don't have to go too in depth on this one but like under what circumstances
48:13
would you stop running the server um i suppose health reasons would top
48:19
the best um if i suddenly had to dramatically cut my
48:25
expenses i can't see that happen in the future but if
48:30
you know if i was suddenly horse and couldn't spare the internet bill
48:37
but uh you know sudden speed of mental illness really health issues in general
48:44
i said and in that case i'd probably try to hand it off to someone's um because like the serger the server hardware is
48:50
paid for and the internet bill ultimate that much it's just like a residential
48:58
shaw cable connection uh the [Music]
49:04
monthly cost of that highs unless things break so i could just hand it to somebody with the reasonable linux
49:12
skills and say go to town just keep it working nice and i have a few people in
49:17
mind who who could all right um so if i was hit by a bus the server
49:24
would probably still muddle along for a while at least oh that's good you've got you've got
49:29
contingent contingency plans yeah yeah so if i die you've got a few months
49:35
at least oh boy getting morbid there
49:41
she shouldn't be thinking about those things until until you're at least at least 70.
49:46
being a system administrator means you have to kind of i mean you have to have three sets of
49:51
backups off-site website and live copy you're
49:56
really taking the like this is like practice for like work and stuff real real real dedicated like
50:02
yep yeah there's some professional pride involved here you know what you want to do a good job
50:08
oh wow yeah um kind of loop it back to the start of the
50:13
server uh why did you choose the the genre of server that you did you got you went with and like smp
50:20
huh it was the easiest i mean um i wanted to run a multiplayer server just because that was the that was the
50:27
new hotness at the time and i had i had run multiplayer servers in the past like i had written a series
50:34
of the classic creative ones if you're for those yeah oh the classic like 2009 error yeah
50:42
all right yeah back when not the the first test of a minecraft multiplayer the ones in a web browser
50:49
uh yes wow in fact i still have
50:55
that still have one of the servers i still have one of those old maps in inquiry
51:01
uh wow if i can teleport you across servers probably not if you do slash spawn
51:09
and go through the creative portal creative plot world i got you all right
51:14
yeah there you go you just joined the game hooray tp
51:20
so this was my pre-insta
51:25
game and a bunch of people played on this this old server
51:32
and i managed to extract the map from the um server.dat and copied it into my
51:38
plot world when did you when did you copy it over um fairly recently a few years ago but
51:46
uh this map dates back to 2008-2009 wow
51:51
that is that's crazy and and you'll you'll see it looks like it is basically your standards um
51:58
classic creative map a lot of a lot of bedrock here so you've got wow this is this is some this is
52:05
some basically some minecraft histories and like i like oh gee like all the older than the main server stuff this is
52:12
emoji og classic minecraft yeah
52:17
damn that's awesome yeah so much time spent fixing
52:24
so much time spent uh fixing one fixing griefing here oh oh did that happen a lot like is that why there's so much
52:30
bedrock in like one corner of the map well my theory was kind of wall players off
52:37
on one side until they've been through some kind of vetting process so the side of the map looks a lot
52:43
the other side of the bedrock wall looks a lot oh i said
52:49
and then i could theoretically just kind of port them over once they've proved themselves to be
52:55
not complete once they're they've proven themselves to be worthy worthy
53:01
but this is an example like this is kind of what it would look like
53:07
uh classic yeah yeah well that's that's really awesome i feel privileged to to view this with
53:13
my own eyes it's crazy i like the spider thing oh wait is that is that from uh
53:20
a show or something like that um i feel if it's a reference i don't
53:25
know i don't know it just like mildly reminded me of something from uh on uh
53:30
the show but i i realized the original thing did not have laser guns
53:37
yeah my partner just laughed at me across the she actually used to play with me on this map
53:43
like she actually made this little garden here oh i can't actually see you by the way here in the oh i am invisible to other
53:50
players um yeah there you are so i'm standing on this little causeway
53:56
little garden here and it's really quite oh wow yeah
54:03
look at that i think the trees were built by hand i guess they didn't have naturally generating trees back in the
54:08
day um i do think these these had to open do yeah
54:14
blend you know there were there were definitely trees in the map generally yeah if you look
54:20
down there it's right there i just uh yeah it's not that old i'm i don't know
54:26
i don't even know if they were sapples at the time so these trees up here in the garden would have
54:33
hand built but those trees may or may not have been planted it's
54:38
too long ago i can't remember fair enough fair enough um
54:44
uh what's your favorite version of minecraft
54:51
yeah hmm
55:00
i would have to say it peaked maybe 1.12.13
55:07
because right around that point they started a ton of kind of useless blocks
55:13
or cosmetic blocks that really didn't have any special purpose and just more surf to add confusion
55:19
building possibilities like do you really need six different colors of wood i mean i guess i guess if
55:25
you're really artistic you can do some cool things with it yeah but gameplay-wise i don't
55:31
know if it really mm-hmm so if you're if you're if you're into pixel art
55:37
yay different colors but yeah like for uh
55:42
for the average like that that has been a complaint as of recent with uh them they add a lot more
55:48
fluff instead of building on the base game like i'd like i i like it when they add
55:54
new mechanics to add complexity and uh that's i'm really looking forward
55:59
to cave updates that that's a strong contender for my new favorite update i actually played a little bit and i
56:05
haven't been that terrified playing minecraft did they really bring back the fear from
56:12
baby they really brought back the fear and so i have to hand it to them
56:18
that's exciting i i want to play that now i have not i've been avoiding anything about new updates just because i
56:24
i can't be bothered it's hard to get excited about yeah you get a little jaded it's like oh 50
56:31
update 1.15 i get i get b's now thanks yeah
56:37
i mean the bees are cute and all they yeah they are but it's like what are you gonna do with them yeah they're gonna buzz around and then
56:44
you're going to do something else yeah but a couple of weeks ago the first time i cracked open into one of those giant
56:51
underground caverns and yeah i just i actually i genuinely got that stomach
56:57
dropping looking down from a height
57:02
that's crazy yeah like the all the new underground stuff as well that's just i'm genuinely impressed they've got some
57:09
great art direction happening there um
57:15
yeah in terms of favorite version uh the case version could be my favorite version so
57:21
we'll see awesome uh yeah for uh like we kind of touched on
57:27
this a little bit earlier like the runes plug-in um it's just like why why why is that on the server why are there like
57:34
not 100 vanilla like plug-ins that are added yeah uh
57:41
runecraft i was against it for a while because it adds some kind of i feel what are
57:47
overpowered mechanics and i still feel they're overpowered like power pick roon for instance gives you the ability to
57:54
enchant a standard pick with something that destroys three by three by three cube
58:00
of touring and it's it's a little much um and
58:06
but it also adds some really fun gameplay mechanics that i think others really enjoy
58:12
um and and it has i was talking earlier about in-game
58:18
mechanics having in-game effects yeah runecraft allows you to draw
58:24
patterns of blocks that have effects in the world and uh
58:30
it's just it's just so much it's just fun you can create teleporters that allow you to go
58:37
from point to point um there's there's really simple things like the compass room tells you which
58:42
way and some crazy ones that create
58:49
or change the time oh that's why uh that riley guy o'reilly
58:54
castle is able to change the time of day so much so are they like built in the world or
58:59
are they like an item that gets created after you build them they're built in the world you draw a pattern of
59:05
blocks and then you activate clicking in the center and it either modifies the blocks in in situ
59:12
or it creates or it put applies in enchantment
59:18
i said okay yeah we didn't have it for quite a while because it broke
59:24
so um what's that but now you have it back but now we have it back and especially with
59:30
the breaking of the stargate plug-in we needed some kind of teleport plug-in that wasn't slash warp
59:36
yeah that one really worked it happened to be and it's been one of the plug-ins that's
59:43
maintained itself over the years so it it it could have broke
59:49
but it somehow has been kept maintained by its author which
59:54
i had my yeah yeah this takes a lot of dedication um
1:00:01
is one of those plugins that's been around since the beginning like it's almost as old as as i have playing
1:00:06
minecraft well so it's like it's like the same age as your server basically it's little bit
1:00:12
yeah well that's crazy like like you you can find runecraft portals dating back
1:00:18
to like second spawn and third spawn where people drawn clear patterns in the ground that
1:00:23
are intended to be teleport pads that's that's crazy because yeah that's one thing on here it's like you won't
1:00:30
see this on like novalin or anything like that i'm not know minecraft online or something but if you go through the map it's like there's like clear
1:00:36
evidence of old like plug-ins and old like old mostly yeah just different types of old plugins like the stargate stuff or
1:00:43
the like even that you had like a biome a sky biomes plug-in yeah i pasted that in a while back
1:00:50
if you paste it in or did you like i did i didn't change the terrain generation or anything i found like a a
1:00:57
floating island at uh y equal
1:01:02
stood in again at an offset at like y equals 64. so we had two layers of
1:01:10
so that's just like uh that was just uh when did you add that in
1:01:15
oh uh i want to say a couple after the server started
1:01:22
it was an ongoing project um so it would have to be like 2012 2011
1:01:29
oh that's really cool yeah um so that one i thought was generated by a
1:01:34
plug-in around in the beta brand beta times but um that's like something you world edited in to create that's cool
1:01:40
somebody else created and i pasted it oh yeah and then i cleaned it up around the edges to
1:01:45
look a little more rated and if you look at the giant pitch there
1:01:52
where i've pasted it you can see like a point where it was
1:01:57
pasted in yeah like where i've tried to smooth out the edges oh yeah like i've noticed that there's a bit of like world
1:02:03
uh world uh like a chunk border buffing
1:02:09
there's a lot of that yeah the terrain generation has changed a lot yeah yeah
1:02:16
um what's like the most notable or like cool thing that's been done on nfl in
1:02:22
your opinion um
1:02:32
cool can mean a bunch of things because some people have done some crazy stuff
1:02:39
like there's this one guy who dug like a 200 by 200 pin just nothing but a giant
1:02:45
ground he took out one block at a time by hand that cool like crazy that's kind of both
1:02:53
what's the biggest the one where you've what you've got like the best thing where you you go and you you look at it and you go
1:02:58
wow that's cool like but then like the you know you get that feeling with a lot of things right i'm sure especially on
1:03:04
here but like what was the one where you're like that is the most notable one that sticks out in my brain
1:03:09
um well that would have to be iron sights it's the city that sarah nodded some time ago serenada and uh the
1:03:18
friend or brother or something i don't recall okay
1:03:23
we can yeah let's let's go to it um real quick okay
1:03:40
all right now we're cooking wow yeah this is this is a huge city this is
1:03:47
yeah i'm genuinely impressed by this build he built a good chunk of it by hand in in survival mode mining all of
1:03:53
the blocks after a while watching him do that and struggling with it i kind of took video
1:04:00
and gave him creative mode for a lot of it and he's been going absolutely to town
1:04:07
that's awesome very creative builder oh yeah look at all you can really see
1:04:12
the like hallmarks of like a old build too when was this started
1:04:18
a long tour i couldn't tell you i'm sorry many years many years i mean it definitely looks
1:04:24
like it's many years old just with all the cobblestone like you don't see a lot of uh giant cities that are uh
1:04:30
that are built with cobblestone as the base of the material most of the time it's like stone or
1:04:36
yeah you know not with slabs and like this is like the old block usage you know a limited block yeah yeah it's a little
1:04:43
old last year and there's like fighter jets in the sky too that's awesome
1:04:49
oh there we go um if you fly around a little you'll see more recent blocks like uh as you travel
1:04:56
out oh yeah the block styles change and types change and he's kind of retrieved retrofitted a
1:05:03
few buildings to have new rocks like i think his most recent project was
1:05:09
to change all the to use this new style deep slate
1:05:14
yeah the roads do look like much more like roads with the deep slit yeah this was cobbled as recently as last month
1:05:22
they've been going around fixing that um
1:05:28
so it's kind of nice to see somebody uh update it to try and make it as good as nice oh yeah absolutely he's like got that
1:05:34
dedication to retroactively fit all this yeah and if anything that's even more
1:05:40
oh yeah i'm way more tedious than you know creatively making something new too
1:05:48
there's like all sorts of little easter eggs in the city yeah they'll have
1:05:54
at one point there's a a lobby with some guard dogs
1:06:02
i'm sorry you cut out there's a room with guard dogs in it yeah
1:06:08
um he he likes to put in the trick he likes like we got a bit of us like a
1:06:13
story or like a like world kind of going on you know to make it look lived
1:06:19
yeah but you asked me what i personally find most impressive uh this guy's been around for five six
1:06:25
years and has done some pretty cool stuff and this is just one of his two he's got an oil
1:06:30
rig somewhere a giant floating aircraft carrier oh that's all the um
1:06:38
actually we can visit too uh what's it called oh paragon
1:06:44
oh i think i i visited that one yesterday yeah um yeah and and he built most of that by hand i think the only
1:06:51
thing uh what was the only thing that um
1:06:56
oh i at one point i took a good chunk of it and mirrored it to the other half you
1:07:02
uh you had like one chunk of it and it just kind of mirrored it helped him
1:07:08
get out the corners right get the details right so that it was correctly aligned
1:07:15
they're very interesting um
1:07:21
climbing to the top of this thing yeah teleport
1:07:26
again there you go this yeah i i i really didn't get grab a scope of this thing while i was well i
1:07:33
was uh trying to figure out how to get on the roof but holy cow
1:07:38
yeah this is oh this reminds us this is like one of those like uh sets for like a movie or something like an aircraft carrier like
1:07:46
hugh you know that uh what is the thing that that flies in the sky in the one of those marvel movies
1:07:51
it looks like that but it's in the water this is huge this just looks like i guess you could say it's good to the scale of a real one
1:07:59
not a movie set what am i talking about all those little support ships around the aircraft carrier he's got um state
1:08:05
rooms that park and there's a lot to explore it's fun
1:08:13
in fact at one point he built a um uh aircraft carriers have an actual
1:08:19
elevator for planes and a runway to spit them up onto so uh you
1:08:26
call them here somewhere for air for uh aircraft to be lifted out of storage bay
1:08:31
and onto the oh there it is yeah i'm looking at one right now cool
1:08:36
uh yeah some of these fighter jets are not claimed by the land claim just let you know
1:08:41
oh well that's good to know um yeah oh and look at the like smoke on
1:08:47
the back of this thing
1:08:52
yeah you know nobody comes out here i'm just going to expand region by 50 blocks
1:09:00
there's lots of glow squids there we go
1:09:07
and the propeller probably not going to affect anybody oh yeah and if it does you'll probably know
1:09:12
pretty quickly people are pretty good about complaining yeah and that's what i've noticed that people are uh
1:09:18
that's all they're really good at sometimes it can feel like i mean if nobody complains
1:09:25
broken right oh yeah that's true how do you know um there you are again um
1:09:31
well you're hosting the server you're still hosting it but like during your time of this the course of these like
1:09:36
over 10 years what's the what's the like biggest mistake you've made while doing it
1:09:43
hmm
1:09:50
well i've i've i've i have deleted the map a couple of times like actually fully wiped it out
1:09:56
and had to restore from backup i mean that's a mistake but it's a recoverable mistake
1:10:02
there's been a couple of catastrophic and oh this isn't a mistake that i made
1:10:10
but one of the moderators um accidentally set coordinates for a world did it wrong and
1:10:16
accidentally rolled it into trench like eight kilometers long
1:10:22
and there's still a couple of pieces of that that weren't repaired uh we couldn't quite
1:10:27
fix it like there's only so far that undo can take you with let it rain yeah
1:10:33
wow so that was pretty great um oh what else
1:10:40
i haven't had any security disclosures like i haven't had any
1:10:47
data leaked or no that's good it's doing better than facebook yeah fingers crossed
1:10:59
yeah if you gave me more time to think about it i could probably probably come up with something but off the top of my head those are
1:11:05
kind of the worst thing okay so like really nothing all that that horrible that's that's a pretty
1:11:11
good track record oh one time i was transitioning from a temporary map back into the permanent
1:11:18
map and i had con you i i had
1:11:25
because to because i i usually create a temporary map and
1:11:30
then i validate all the plugins to make sure everything's working yeah um so i had copied all of the plugins from the
1:11:36
temporary map to the new map and then i had done then then we had a
1:11:42
griefer and i did a rollback in a certain area but the rollback had been done against
1:11:47
the old map not the actual permanent map so it it
1:11:53
messed up a ton of terrain because all it i did a vlog
1:11:59
i did a uh log what's called a roll uh excuse me
1:12:06
gather your words it's fine um log block and other block protection plugins can keep a
1:12:13
record of what players have done over a per time and you can undo or redo a player's
1:12:21
entire set of that time now what happens if you take a player's
1:12:28
actions on one map and replay that log on another map
1:12:33
suddenly like somebody places a dirt block at cordon at a certain coordinates on one
1:12:39
map and that's just you know a lake another nice and it just created a huge
1:12:48
and that was that was definitely uh is there probably still some remnants of that or did you manage to reset that
1:12:54
no i think we fully i i think i'm fully but only back up from the day before
1:13:00
okay
1:13:06
that's unfortunate the value of good backups i cannot underline yeah good backups running a minecraft server
1:13:13
because you are gonna mess it up oh yeah i've done that a couple of times myself yeah every time before i do anything
1:13:21
like plug-in related i'm baker backup or any updates related i make a bike up as well but i don't do it every cut every
1:13:27
day i just don't have the space for it online computer um
1:13:33
well i do what are called incremental backups and uh you do a full backup every week like an entire snapshot and
1:13:40
then every subsequent day for the next you only copy the files that change
1:13:45
oh yeah and uh you can rebuild the state of the system and on
1:13:50
any given from the incremental backups plus the back oh okay that's actually that's cool all
1:13:57
right yeah i'm not very tech savvy unfortunately so like i have no idea how that like how i
1:14:03
would implement that myself but that's like uh it's neat i mean it never really occurred to me to do something like that
1:14:09
yeah definitely save some somebody use a program called duplicity which um
1:14:14
handles all of the details okay awesome um
1:14:20
so we talked a bit about griefing earlier but like are there any like what's the most memorable uh incident of griefing and how did you what did it
1:14:27
what happened during it and what did you do to fix it
1:14:33
um the the most memorable griefs have to be
1:14:38
the earliest ones like uh one guy went in the first couple
1:14:44
of months of the server because we had built highways going to the four compass points from the spawn the original spawn
1:14:50
point uh he had uh spammed lava blocks among along several kilometers
1:14:58
and uh you know you know how lava griefing works you drop a little splash you can't get rid of that
1:15:05
stuff you can't get rid of that stuff it's everywhere there's still people
1:15:10
there's still pieces today yeah you can still find little bits and pieces but i clean it up when i
1:15:16
find it so if you kind of look go if you go to the highway around first pond and
1:15:21
then swim in the water underneath it you'll see like little bits of cobble here and along the highway
1:15:27
yeah i know where you and there's just this one guy who did all of that it must have taken him
1:15:35
hours yeah it's like some people are incredibly
1:15:40
persis yeah there's like uh this kind of reminds me of like this
1:15:45
the lengths people will go to on like the servers like anarchy servers to destroy something it's like sometimes
1:15:51
there's just more effort put into destroying something than there was put into building it yeah it's it's it almost gets elevated
1:15:58
to an art form oh yeah oh yeah you have to admire the sheer
1:16:04
doggedness yeah uh ever since then we've just always had rollback and backup plug-in
1:16:11
maybe more like respect the effort but not admire it
1:16:17
don't condone running any kind of game server you have
1:16:22
a an asymmetry problem because it's generally easier to destroy than okay
1:16:28
so you have to be able to reverse that asymmetry it always has to be to roll back grieving than it is to
1:16:35
create because otherwise you'll drown will absolutely drown yeah yeah i agree with that it's one of
1:16:42
that's one of the biggest flaws 2b has is they they just don't have a counter to griefing nothing is
1:16:48
there's nothing that can combat it effectively yeah and they encourage him that's that's
1:16:54
true i mean it's not like an exactly an issue but it's for like people who who visit the server for reasons that don't
1:17:00
involve just you know to see things it's kind of it's disappointing on there
1:17:07
yeah it's a little heartbreaking putting in so much effort into something and just watching some guy walk up with a
1:17:12
torch although i'd say there's there's some it's it's it creates a different mindset
1:17:19
when building something like for me personally like i need to know that if i go on a server and i build something
1:17:25
really cool on there some guy can just come by and just nuke it like it just for me personally that makes me feel
1:17:32
good yeah i just like if i know it's temporary you know like that's one thing griefing does to like a world it's like
1:17:38
it as in an element of like erosion that doesn't exist in like like normal minecraft which is like
1:17:45
yeah i totally see that it has its pros and cons of course but um more cons than pros but
1:17:51
you know there's like a life lesson in here about the fundamental impermanence of all
1:17:56
yeah i am ozymandias king of kings look upon my works human despair
1:18:05
it's just a very nihilistic message but everything we make get destroyed that's
1:18:12
just the way the world is yeah everything we create will crumble into dust and that's a fact of life
1:18:19
and building that into your gameplay kind is kind of depressing but it's depressing but it's also kind of like
1:18:25
like visionary yeah i mean you gotta learn to
1:18:31
the impermanence of life in general oh yeah there's there's there are life lessons
1:18:37
to be had there and if you can if you can cope with seeing your dirt shack bird uh destroyed in minecraft you can
1:18:43
cope with a lot of life setbacks you know what you you pick up your and you move on and you build something
1:18:49
it's also going to get destroyed but take a deep breath and move on oh yeah you got you get like into it like a zen
1:18:55
about it kind of yeah yeah yeah totally all right like uh talking about um everything getting wiped and removed and
1:19:03
everything for not kind of uh kind of into like the opposite vein of that if you could start from the
1:19:08
beginning what would you do differently hmm
1:19:14
with all of your knowledge currently
1:19:20
smaller map border smaller because players banded out really
1:19:27
quickly really fast and it made the map very quickly on
1:19:32
uh players generated a ton of terrain very
1:19:38
quickly because when you log into an infinite world what's the first thing you're going to do a lot of them expand yeah
1:19:45
you're going to pick a direction and go you're just going to try to be as far away from people as possible
1:19:51
and the people generated like the map was like six gigs within a year and i had to throw down a 20k
1:20:01
how large is the map currently um inside in terms of gigabytes about 25
1:20:07
26. so it's not the largest by any means
1:20:13
yeah that was kind of this same size as one of my old servers yeah
1:20:19
i didn't enforce a map a map limit so we just like we generated chunks out into the millions yeah you
1:20:26
try to i try to stop people from making useless terrain mm-hmm yeah
1:20:33
your render is very like uh has a lot of like unloaded chunks yeah there's there's quite a few places
1:20:39
that people happen to get which is which is gratifying i've also reserved quite a bit of land
1:20:46
by slapping down big world guard regions so as future content patches come out that requires terrain i'll just
1:20:54
nip off a few of that and then and then i can reach great what uh um
1:21:01
yeah so like is that what's your plan for when the when the map like uh when people generate everything inside the
1:21:07
border put out the border i mean what else just expand it
1:21:12
yeah um i do keep an eye out opportunity leading errors and i have to leave you
1:21:20
if if there's an obvious or an obvious idea notice that actually i was looking at your render and i was
1:21:26
like why does it look like this entire section of the world has been like edited in separately but it's it's
1:21:32
because the trunk borders are like a square but it's like that must be from you resetting parts of the world yeah i
1:21:38
have absolutely destroyed that part of the world dealt with few complaints
1:21:43
uh told um and regen regenerated the terrain yeah
1:21:50
and so oh yeah you try not to delete anybody's existing builds
1:21:55
but i i've i've done a couple oh no r.i.p
1:22:02
rip um yeah so like back to the the question of starting what would all over what would
1:22:08
you do differently we didn't really answer that i don't know if i'd do much differently
1:22:14
oh besides just make the maps shorter smaller yeah like i'd be a little more conservative about
1:22:20
letting people spread out i try and keep people like in recent patches i've tried to keep
1:22:27
people closer together so that they can interact a little more because if people spread out they're not
1:22:32
really talking to each other in the early maps people tended to
1:22:38
congregate more but now they tend to build all little castles and uh have
1:22:43
their own little victims i i kind of miss the fact that people had towns back in the day
1:22:50
and they don't really do that but maybe that's an artifact of just not having as many
1:22:55
i think so i think that'll change and i've i have a small feeling that over the next coming months that's going to
1:23:02
change yeah yeah if we get a good influx of players i could see people cooperating more that's for sure
1:23:08
uh what is your advice for aspiring minecraft server owners
1:23:14
um well keep good backups for sure
1:23:21
and listen to your players they they're not dumb
1:23:26
they know what they want and [Music]
1:23:32
maybe don't give them everything they but try to listen past what they're actually
1:23:38
saying to what they actually need like what what a player wants is not necessarily
1:23:45
what they need i but what they're saying is they want a
1:23:51
path stuff that that's right you got to make that like
1:23:56
part of the the experience engaging again you know you got it yeah just might so difficult health has been
1:24:02
struggling with making that aging oh yeah i think there's a new update though
1:24:08
we could change that yeah to let a lot of content i'm i'm looking forward to seeing the underground cities
1:24:14
oh yeah oh yeah and they're going to be like over the current chunks of the in the server right now
1:24:20
oh yeah that's going to be nutty you'll have people like going to the beta terrain and in dev terrain and just
1:24:25
building a hat like an entire like city underneath there yeah at a stroke they've doubled
1:24:31
the amount of usable space in them which is just gonna be great that'll add to map density too
1:24:38
yeah but that's yeah you'll be able to have like layered builds and stuff way more than what we currently have
1:24:44
yeah and it'll be kind of neat to see people coming back to roll just dig down
1:24:50
to it again more more basement sellers less skyscrapers
1:25:02
ah yeah oh well uh if it keeps people interested i suppose it's uh it's worth it what's
1:25:09
the uh people having fun yeah as long as people are having fun it's all it's all good
1:25:15
what's the i uh like speaking of players and listening to them and whatnot it's like what's the ideal player uh for in
1:25:22
your mind who would like play your server hmm
1:25:35
someone i'm someone who's a good conversationalist
1:25:42
and um
1:25:48
someone who gives a good feedback hmm i don't know there's so many
1:25:54
different types of people you want to have around and everybody's
1:26:00
everybody's unique and offers their own perspective i like goodyear
1:26:05
okay um well then on like a a mirror question
1:26:11
what's like the the opposite of an ideal player what's what's the worst possible person you
1:26:16
could have join your server and that you would immediately go no go away leave ban banned gone
1:26:23
what are what are some big red flags for you how about an indie player well edge lords anybody who's trying to
1:26:29
provoke a reaction hmm list um
1:26:37
yeah people who are constantly complaining and there's good complaining about
1:26:42
complaining there's whining yeah so
1:26:47
i won't really uh kind of my favorite players will
1:26:54
bring maturity and uh
1:27:00
people who de-escalate conflict people who escalate conflict are my
1:27:05
favorite people who can calm down the situation
1:27:11
uh there are the people who do who escalate conflict are your least favorite kind yeah
1:27:17
and you know the kind of person i'm talking oh yeah the drop of a hat
1:27:22
and they'll interpret everything somebody says worst possible oh yeah
1:27:30
unfortunately i don't think those people very well that's true yeah they need they need more excitement um than like a slow burn
1:27:38
yeah yeah if you just kind of approach them with for instance most of the time
1:27:45
with indifference yes um
1:27:51
i i'd like to talk about the uh the the like uh the old uh version of hell in like
1:27:57
minecraft nether that's underneath the map i found that yesterday with some a guy
1:28:03
or i was told about it that is so cool like can you tell me about that a little bit
1:28:09
um okay yeah yeah if well i forget what the warp name is but hey
1:28:14
that was wandering around there that is one cool ass place it even has like like generation for uh it even has like uh
1:28:21
mobs that uh from the version like like pigment and stuff that spawns
1:28:27
it's it's it's not it's a block of water it's not as complicated as story um i
1:28:33
took an ex well i was telling you about the floating island map that i paced above
1:28:38
the ground yeah this is the same map but i've placed underground so a bunch of floating
1:28:44
island below ground level and added a bedrock
1:28:50
and then and then pasted in a bunch of lava or added a
1:29:03
in fact if you really looked closely at it the original island were
1:29:10
in dev terrain and that somebody like i didn't create the island map that
1:29:16
if someone else made the island mapping you you modified it and remnants of it that you can tell like
1:29:22
the trees i'm guessing yeah yeah you can see bits and pieces i
1:29:28
over time i've kind of changed it i converted like a lot of the sand i converted to
1:29:34
solstice blocks and a lot of the dirt i converted to etherstones
1:29:39
um i did some overlay to
1:29:44
convert various blocks into other blocks dropped a whole bunch of sand
1:29:50
added lava i see is this um in biome like inspired by the nether or by like
1:29:56
the og like hell world inf dev kind of dude i don't remember the hell world from infdev to be honest okay um but
1:30:03
this is an actual biome like i've yeah you've switched it to nether i've noticed that yeah
1:30:10
yeah if you hit f3 that means that if uh that means you won't be able to place water down
1:30:16
here right oh really is that a thing i don't know it doesn't mean that because it's if
1:30:21
it's considered another biome
1:30:27
i got i got you covered oh never mind i'm wrong you can place it is water flow turned
1:30:33
off on here um yes if you do slash rg info
1:30:40
play so water flow did not yep
1:30:45
look like i don't remember the motivation for that probably to keep people from turning
1:30:51
lava too yeah i think i noticed a little bit of it that was turned into like down here a little bit
1:30:58
uh looks like someone was getting did you do this or did it was someone like filling this in
1:31:07
there's a piece of bedrock just here oh who knows where that came there was
1:31:12
actually a bug a while back with log block the plugin used to use bedrock
1:31:18
as uh as a tool and under some circumstance
1:31:24
with a piece of bedrock inventory and a couple of player actual stacks of rock
1:31:29
probably left over that's cool if you've discovered those players would you remove those bedrock pieces from
1:31:35
them or what i don't know i i would remove them when i find them but i i
1:31:41
i tend to turn a blind eye towards certain exploits as they're pretty
1:31:47
harmless for the most part i see i mean if if a player isn't being a jerk it's
1:31:52
about stuff like getting their hands on bedrock they're not going around spawn covering
1:31:58
every single thing and exactly you're they're being responsible for it with that they're just having fun
1:32:03
with not causing problems whatever they can have their their bedrock blocks
1:32:10
and one of the challenges of running your server is that players will have
1:32:17
old stuff that they've received as a result of bugs
1:32:25
or mistakes by the administrator um like i've
1:32:30
for instance a while back i set um eggs to drop from mobs like a creeper had a one percent
1:32:37
drugs dropping a creeper egg so of course people built farms for careers
1:32:43
and there's a few people with still a few stacks of creepering that's crazy you know what it's fine yeah i mean as
1:32:50
long as like creepers don't even do block damage anymore so yeah yeah i turned that off
1:32:55
it's just completely insane yeah for a long term map creepers are
1:33:01
critically extreme especially the superpowers
1:33:06
yeah the need f any kind of long-term map pretty much
1:33:12
has to turn off creepers because you'll just end up with the craters yeah
1:33:17
well it depends on like the goal for the long-term map right that's true yeah like i know a few servers like 2b or sim
1:33:24
pvp uh where they just they just the goal is to just have like basically a giant
1:33:30
world that just is on mostly unregulated right and the chaos is the point oh yeah yeah
1:33:36
yeah uh with the with the
1:33:42
new and upcoming publicity that uh the youtuber scene is uh
1:33:48
going to probably bring uh what are your what are your plans yeah what do you
1:33:53
what are your plans to either capitalize on and or just for the surfer in general in the future regardless of players
1:34:01
i will probably raise the player cap marginally maybe up to 20 or so
1:34:07
and i'll bring on a couple more moderate can't systematically extending the
1:34:13
player cap because i cannot my brain cannot handle large
1:34:20
and i really prefer the smaller so i i figure if
1:34:26
if and when we get a huge amount of exposure i um
1:34:31
figured we'll just ride it out until until the ice dines down until the hype
1:34:37
dies down and we get like a core of repeated players i gotcha gotcha
1:34:43
you don't want it to be too crazy yeah fair enough and it's like yeah that means like a lot of stuff like uh the
1:34:48
the terrain that in like let's say the older versions with all those like corrupted trees that'll start to dwindle
1:34:54
when new players join and maybe mine those more and other other things right other like relatively other like smaller
1:35:01
builds that aren't claimed might get built over or destroyed just over the course like even not like
1:35:07
maliciously just as time goes on yeah it's unfortunate and you protect what you can
1:35:13
you know life goes on yeah like like when it comes to let's say art restoration you can't save everything
1:35:19
right so you just you give the impression of of everything more than the individual
1:35:24
and i've never been too focused on protecting every little shack that's yeah 20.
1:35:31
like uh that's like kind of the entire opposite of what minecraft online does they have like a
1:35:36
a hyper like focused mod team they have got like a plugin that says whenever a block is
1:35:42
broken and if it's broken by who and if if someone because they don't have a land claim plug-in they have a land
1:35:49
tells you what's being broken plug-in and if you break a block any block that is not placed by you
1:35:56
it tells the mods they teleport behind you and they start like angrily
1:36:01
asking you why are you griefing the server what are you doing and then and then if you go uh i just played i just
1:36:06
broke a block dude i put it back they ban you
1:36:12
that's not even a joke either um i mean if you don't immediately go i'm sorry i'm sorry there was a complete accident
1:36:17
don't pay me please they will just remove you because they you know they don't have the patience for it and there's just too many people who come
1:36:23
join that server all the time yeah that explains something from a couple days ago actually
1:36:29
terrified of borrowing somebody's horse that they found out in the plans
1:36:34
oh yeah oh my god can i take this something going on me what's going to happen oh yeah because minecraft online
1:36:41
is a president for the harshness with it come when it comes to enforcing rules they have like 30 000 player bands
1:36:49
or something like that and with the number of players they have i can kind of understand that because
1:36:55
you kind of have to be authoritarian fascist or get away
1:37:01
there's no like well there is a core community there but they have like a kind of like what you have but like way
1:37:06
larger like 50 or 100 people and it's like almost i think it's international as well
1:37:11
uh like different times of the day have like different like people flying and stuff and they've got like different mod
1:37:16
communities that like not mod communities but like different people who play at like different times right and they got to keep them all
1:37:22
they got to stop them from breaking blocks and and this is one thing that i'd like to commend you on as well is that um
1:37:28
you use like new plugins right you're what are you running paper paper
1:37:33
like that in fact i just upgraded it like yesterday yeah minecraft online
1:37:40
runs like i think they run canary which is like a port of an old old old old uh
1:37:46
i i yeah something like that uh operating system yeah and that it's part of why they've been like they're their
1:37:52
server lag so much uh and also like um uh just like for their plugins aren't
1:37:58
like very good because they they refuse to like switch to like a newer system i don't know exactly why maybe
1:38:05
it's just hard to convert all that information but uh it's really like caused their number one cause for like server problems as
1:38:12
far as lag so they're not taking advantage of yeah radically impressive developments in a
1:38:18
server that's they were on 1.7 for like after 1.7 came out they stayed on it
1:38:26
until until a few until seven months ago when they updated to 1.12
1:38:33
um and it's like like 1.12 i think is less laggy now but it's like
1:38:38
they they they had before it took like you break a block and you'd wait like three seconds and
1:38:44
then it would actually break yeah it was painful it's like an
1:38:49
entirely different way to play the game i remember one of the one of the moderators or ex-moderators now um he's
1:38:55
mr bricks on server if you've recognized him he was telling me how he switched to playing a different server
1:39:02
after he quit minecraft online or something and then he's just like it's like whoa i'm getting like weird ptsd
1:39:08
from seeing a block that i break just break when i when i click it and i don't like wait and he's like i'm
1:39:14
getting tripped up witchcraft yeah he's like everything is running so smoothly i've been like we used to like
1:39:20
got like this mental block expecting everything to be so slow and painful
1:39:25
because he's been just used to that for so long um yeah there's like psychological
1:39:31
experiments where you delay somebody's uh reaction time by
1:39:37
by 100 milliseconds plus they develop some kind of psychosis
1:39:42
i think i'm broken yeah you've just broken an entire generation yeah
1:39:50
um all right and we've we've got one last question for you here
1:39:56
yeah um yeah we made it to the end of the giant list
1:40:03
um do you see yourself still running the server in 10 years
1:40:09
um yeah i think so
1:40:16
i mean i've got a path for the next four years at least with the current hardware i don't see myself replacing it for a
1:40:22
while um so at least that
1:40:27
okay and yeah for ten years is pretty reasonable it's
1:40:36
dude dude i'm going to be in my 30s i mean how how how weird is that oh yeah
1:40:44
that i mean i've only i'm young
1:40:49
you don't you don't notice it right yeah it creeps up on you yeah
1:40:54
that's what i've been holding excuse me while i work through or work through some existential dread there a little bit of
1:41:01
a are you having a mid-life crisis it starts with this video this uh this
1:41:06
interview your midlife crisis no no i'm pretty past life i've got like
1:41:12
my five tests you're five teslas
1:41:17
yeah paid for by the med server oh yeah for the mad cash that the the donations from the server are breaking in for you
1:41:25
exactly um but yeah 10 years is is well within my planning
1:41:31
i mean i i i can realistically see 10 years being assuming minecraft is around 10 years
1:41:36
from now i mean although these days microsoft has their grubby little claws into minecraft and
1:41:43
it's a multi-billion yeah franchise so uh uh
1:41:49
minecraft isn't going away anytime soon yeah it's just does it stay good for ten years that's the yeah
1:41:57
assuming minecraft itself doesn't totally jump um and and even then i'll probably i can
1:42:04
it's all staying on an older version i mean like minecraft online is doing it
1:42:09
did it for for with 1.7 2b2t is doing it with 1.12
1:42:15
if they've been stuck on that for four years or something like that yeah and we were on 1.13 for a couple years
1:42:22
just because i couldn't be asked to deal with it well i got i got on the tail end of that
1:42:29
um yeah i got to experience the the last working star gate uh plug i probably have the the last recorded video of
1:42:36
stargate plugins working that's very possible there's other servers that you probably not too many
1:42:44
yeah i'd say that's probably like a rare rarely used plugin these days
1:42:49
um yeah um well i yeah what
1:42:54
oh sorry go ahead oh i don't know i was just uh saying it's a big pleasure to just be able to do this
1:43:00
interview with you after uh having found this a year ago this is you know what you've done here is like is
1:43:07
amazing really i mean like they might seem a little bit monotonous and a lot of
1:43:12
effort for you but like for someone like me to to just stumble across this dude you do it's like it is like one of
1:43:18
the most amazing discoveries ever just the one of the main most amazing things to like exist for minecraft history like
1:43:25
dude you've hit like uh the record for the oldest map like that's still running
1:43:30
um and i think i've heard a fair claim to that yeah i i think you have like the most
1:43:37
definitive claim out of them all actually um and to have to be so like unknown like
1:43:43
most of these servers have been found before and like i didn't know anymore existed actually um
1:43:49
and to find one like this with a with a map this well preserved too
1:43:54
um and like with like an owner is like like as capable as you uh which is like it's not like not every
1:44:01
place has got like a map every a backup happening every every week full and like a semi map back up every day
1:44:10
yeah and then we've got the block rollbacks for and and big fighter
1:44:16
but yeah so i'd just like to say thank you thank you for keeping the server up for for everyone uh to to just have it
1:44:22
exist and this is like a real relic it's basically like a museum almost uh yeah
1:44:27
yeah i i i'd like to comment that
1:44:32
big things are built brick by brick so uh when you're in the thick of it you
1:44:38
don't necessarily but you're putting down a brick every day and uh
1:44:44
it's like that bojack horseman episode oh i love you guys do it every day
1:44:49
oh yeah it's like it's like yeah like what you're saying it's build something huge but and if you just
1:44:54
do a small thing every day eventually you look back and it's this giant edifice
1:45:03
yeah because it's like when you start the server right you don't you didn't see yourself running it for the next like decade right
1:45:08
it's like yeah this is fun sure we'll just keep on doing yeah
1:45:14
well i think that's a great note 10 this all off on and uh thank you uh do you have do you have any last words for like
1:45:19
uh any anybody watching um stay in school kids i don't know
1:45:26
don't do drugs don't do drugs don't walk the crooked road
1:45:31
or or only do the good drugs make sure to make sure to validate the quality of your drugs and the source of
1:45:38
your drugs before you do them all right okay come on top 10 list what are the top 10 good drugs
1:45:46
um i have no opinion i know you have an opinion you just
1:45:51
don't want to say i make a really good apple cider
1:45:57
all right uh thank you and uh i'll talk to you at a later point yeah
1:46:02
pleasure to talk to you have a good day [Music]
1:46:10
all righty you did it you made it an hour and 45 minutes of
1:46:16
beautiful beautiful interview footage and video and
1:46:22
questions and and knowledge being dispensed you made it to the end i feel like if you've made it this far you
1:46:28
might be one of those people who would be interested in financially supporting novalin um you know you know for the
1:46:35
future so i have uh i have a i have a donation link
1:46:40
uh well i have the server's donation link uh available in the description as well as on screen right now
1:46:46
uh so if you want to go donate support the server financially uh maybe keep it help keep it running or update plugins
1:46:53
somehow you can all do that as well as you know a link to the discord server and the ip
1:46:59
to the actual server as well as the website will all be in the description just uh
1:47:04
yeah check out the server for yourself i hope i hope you enjoyed watching this video
1:47:11
and interview uh with our boss as much as i had fun filming and uh editing it
1:47:18
in post not that there was much editing needed uh
